Immigration is increasingly chaotic, with smuggling gangs undermining border security. Water companies are polluting seas and rivers while rewarding overseas shareholders with hefty dividends, despite their own financial struggles and outdated infrastructure. Topley criticizes the impact of the woke agenda on public services. He points out that nurses and teachers are burdened with excessive bureaucracy, diverting their focus from frontline duties. Additionally, he notes that the military has been significantly reduced, leaving the country vulnerable in conventional conflicts like the ongoing situation in Ukraine. Frustrated with the current state of affairs, Topley found a beacon of hope in Reform UK's policies. He praises them for their common-sense approach, contrasting sharply with the ongoing Conservative infighting and mismanagement. Topley supports the proposal to raise the starting point of income tax to \u00a320,000 and reform the benefits system, which he believes will reintegrate economically inactive individuals into the workforce, benefiting both their mental health and society as a whole. Topley is convinced that the Tories have failed and that a shift towards socialism is not the solution. This belief motivated him to join Reform UK and to stand as a candidate, aiming to restore the nation to its former glory. Outside of politics, Paul enjoys fishing, shooting, and following football and cricket. He is also a passionate cook who grows his own fruit and vegetables, valuing locally sourced, seasonal produce. Thirty years ago, Topley founded Churches Fire & Security.

With two O levels to his name, Raymond's determination and hard work propelled him through his career. Having been sponsored by BT to pursue both a BA and later an MSc degree, Raymond's commitment to education and self-improvement is evident. After early retirement at 49, he ventured into the plumbing business, eventually selling his successful company after eight years. His passion for passing on his skills led him back to Basingstoke College as a plumbing and heating instructor for his final two working years. Politically conservative and disillusioned by the direction of his former party, Raymond found himself seeking a new home in the Reform Party. His decision was fueled by a desire to restore what he sees as lost values in governance and to address the pressing issues facing the nation. As a Reform Party PPC, Raymond's priorities lie in securing the nation's borders, streamlining the healthcare system to reduce inefficiencies, and significantly downsizing government. He advocates for policies to transition welfare recipients back into the workforce, bolster the armed forces, and invest in robust energy infrastructure, including research into nuclear power. Raymond opposes what he perceives as an overly hasty pursuit of green initiatives, advocating instead for a balanced approach that embraces technological advancements gradually. He also champions reforms in education to counter what he views as ideological indoctrination, emphasizing a return to fundamental principles. Central to Raymond's vision is a return to a government that truly represents the will of the people, eschewing any tendencies towards authoritarianism.

After relocating to the South East in the late 1980s, Ian built a successful career in business, which took him overseas. His international experiences have highlighted the contrast between how other nations manage their societies compared to the UK.

He criticizes the dysfunction within local government and the accelerating national decline under Westminster's leadership since Tony Blair. Ian believes that many issues in Bexhill and Battle reflect broader national problems, requiring comprehensive solutions. Ian is particularly troubled by the controversial North Eye development and the shortage of social housing, contributing to a growing homelessness issue. He is also frustrated by the difficulties in accessing GP and dental appointments, attributing these issues to NHS bureaucratic inefficiencies and wasted resources. Ian's platform includes tackling the impact of mass immigration on housing and health services as a top priority. Ian is committed to addressing the stagnant incomes of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens facing rising living costs. He is alarmed by the surge in crime, which disproportionately affects the poorest, and criticizes the police for focusing on \"woke\" ideologies rather than effective crime prevention. Ian advocates for a more accountable and action-oriented approach to law enforcement. Ian brings direct experience in addressing the issues within utility companies, from rail to gas and water. He has confronted overcompensated executives and ineffective board members, and he is critical of the recent three-day water outage and persistent flooding in the area.

He is concerned about the declining quality of school places and academic standards, criticizing the Department for Education for allowing progressive ideologies to overshadow fundamental educational values.

I was born in the United States and moved to the UK in 1981. Whilst raising my son as a single parent I worked across a variety of high performing and dynamic industries. I was manager for both UK and Norway for the French toiletries company L' Herbier de Provence. I moved from retail into media as Business Development Manager for Humana international headhunting at executive level across UK & Europe during the dotcom boom for the telecom industry. My husband Matt and I changed our careers totally in 2004 when we fell in love with a Riverside pub. We still own the pub as semi-retired publicans, we moved to the Chichester area 10 years ago and have spent most of our time renovating our home and enjoying all this coastal area has to offer. I am not a politician. I joined the Brexit party in 2016 and campaigned tirelessly for them all over the country. I stood as a Brexit Party PPC for Chichester until we were asked to stand down in order for Boris Johnson to pull the wool over our eyes. For the past seven years I have watched in horror as all Brexit opportunities voted for by 17.4 million people have been neglected and purposely undermined. I'm not afraid to challenge the mediocrity in Westminster and will fight for Chichester's voice in Parliament. This is a once in a lifetime vote to save Great Britain. The Conservatives have taken us to financial collapse, public services, energy and health sectors are in severe crisis. We are facing global conflict and our armed forces are at breaking point. We rely on the French providing us energy while the French rely on us taking care of their excess immigration at a huge cost, not only financially but socially and culturally. The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have no idea how to govern, they all want to drag us back into the EU where everything would be done for them. We would again be dictated to by unelected bureaucrats at a huge cost. The Liberal Democrats would take us into the single market. The Reform Party have put together a team of astute business candidates. We are not career politicians, most are capable business people with proven track records. Reform will rebuild Great Britain by investing in industry like the British steel we were once so proud of, nuclear reactors & improving the grid. Reform will scrap HS2 saving \u00a325+ billion, scrap Net Zero & also invest in our armed forces. These are just a few reasons why I am standing in Chichester for Reform. Reform UK will secure Britain's future as a free, proud and independent sovereign nation. If you live in the Chichester area and you have time to volunteer to help us campaign in this next very important general election, please contact us by email. I Look forward to meeting you soon.",

As a long-time local resident, Matthew has developed a strong connection to the area. His commitment to the community led him to stand for office, successfully becoming a town councillor for the Alton - Wooteys ward last year. Matthew's interest in politics began during his childhood in 1970s London, a time marked by industrial strikes and the threat of IRA terrorism. Amidst the challenges, he also witnessed the power of community and the positive contributions made by integrated immigrants. These experiences ignited a lifelong passion for politics and public service. Matthew has watched the political landscape of Britain deteriorate. He believes that the broken promises, incompetence, and divisive policies of the three traditional parties have left the country in crisis.

    "biography": "Chris Scott was born in Surrey and spent his formative years in colonial southern Africa from the age of six. At 18, he returned to the UK to pursue a career in aviation, training as a commercial pilot. His impressive career spanned 22 years in command, flying wartime Dakotas and various jet airliners, including 12 years spent training fellow pilots. Now settled on the Downs with his wife, Chris is a devoted family man, regularly spending time with his grandchildren, thanks to his two surviving children living nearby. His son also runs a successful architectural visualization business within the constituency. After attending Airbus courses in Toulouse, Chris embarked on his first retirement project in France, overseeing the construction of a holiday home. A keen supporter of Anglo-European cooperation, Chris's experience with Airbus-whose British wings predate the UK's entry into the EEC-reinforced his commitment to this collaboration. However, over time, he became disillusioned with the UK's treatment by European elites, particularly given Britain's unique contributions to European unity in both World Wars and its honesty as a member of the European Union. Chris's growing disillusionment with the Conservative Party, particularly under David Cameron, led him to join UKIP in 2015. He actively campaigned during the 2015 General Election and the 2016 Referendum. Frustrated with the government's handling of Brexit and the collapse of UKIP, Chris joined the Brexit Party in 2019. He campaigned during the European Elections, which led to an overwhelming victory and the subsequent resignation of Theresa May. By standing down half of its candidates, the Brexit Party paved the way for Boris Johnson's 80-seat majority and the promise to \"get Brexit done.\" Despite the promises made, Chris firmly believes Brexit remains incomplete. With Northern Ireland's trade still controlled by Brussels, foreign exploitation of UK fisheries, and a European court dictating border control, Chris is disheartened by the current government's handling of post-Brexit Britain. The soaring levels of immigration, particularly the unchecked arrival of thousands of migrants from France, adds to his concern. Chris sees this as a national failure, with British citizens subjected to long waits at Passport Control while illegal migrants are aided by the UK's own Border Force. After 14 years of Conservative governance, Chris believes the UK is in decline. From the breakdown of law and order to the government's mishandling of the pandemic, including unnecessary lockdowns and school closures, Chris has witnessed the erosion of public trust. He is critical of the \"Net Zero\" energy policy, which he sees as unrealistic, authoritarian, and economically damaging, especially for families struggling with high energy costs. Outsourcing manufacturing to China, the world's largest polluter, is another failure he attributes to the current leadership. Chris is deeply concerned with the rise of \"woke\" ideologies that have infiltrated schools and society. He is appalled by the promotion of gender questioning among children, the inability of political leaders to define fundamental concepts like femininity, and the prioritization of diversity over merit in armed forces recruitment. The NHS is another major concern for Chris, who points to inefficiencies, long waiting lists, and a lack of motivation to train home-grown staff as critical issues. He believes that many young people are encouraged to pursue university degrees with little career value, rather than entering vocational training that would benefit the country's workforce. As a resident of East Surrey, Chris is acutely aware of the local challenges his community faces. Rising theft and assaults, housing shortages driven by immigration, and the overburdening of schools, transport, and hospitals are just a few of the pressing concerns. Waiting times at A&E continue to grow, and Surrey's green spaces are under threat. Chris is particularly critical of the Surrey County Council's decision to sell its Kingston headquarters at a knockdown price and the deteriorating condition of the local roads, which pose a significant risk to cyclists. Chris is standing as a Reform UK candidate in the upcoming general election, deeply committed to representing the interests of East Surrey residents. He believes the current Conservative government, despite recent attempts to reverse policies, has failed the nation. Labour or a Lib-Lab coalition, in his view, would only exacerbate these issues. Reform UK, the only party offering nationwide candidates, represents the common-sense values and aspirations of ordinary people who no longer recognize the country they love. Chris considers it a privilege to stand for Reform UK in his home constituency. As a candidate for a new and underfunded party, Chris is calling for volunteers to support his campaign in East Surrey. Whether through leafleting, door-knocking, or providing venues for meetings, he encourages those who share his vision for a better future to get involved and join the fight for meaningful change.",

To support his family during this time, he adapted by working as a taxi driver. Paul Webb believes that nearly three decades of mismanagement under both the Conservative and Labour governments have led the country into decline. With 14 years of Tory rule followed by 13 years under Labour, he feels that the British people have been let down by these established parties. Reform UK, he argues, was born out of a need to fill the political void and provide a fresh voice for the people. According to Paul, the time for change is now, and Reform UK is committed to representing the real interests of the British people. As East Thanet prepares for the upcoming election on July 4th, Paul Webb stresses the importance of every vote. He asserts that a vote for the Conservatives is essentially a vote for Labour, and that Reform UK is the only party willing to stand up to Keir Starmer and offer genuine opposition. Paul is confident that real change starts at the polling stations in East Thanet. Paul Webb reflects on the 2015 general election, where 16,000 people in Thanet cast their vote for Nigel Farage. He believes Farage was right then, and that Reform UK's policies are the solution to the country's current challenges.

However, by the seventies, he saw the country falter during events like the three-day work week and the undue influence of unelected unions. Now, as he observes the continued decline of the UK, Mark is committed to reversing this trend. Initially trained in Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Mark transitioned to the construction industry, where he built a successful 30-year career. He worked on projects ranging from large government initiatives to smaller and medium-sized developments. Often called upon as a troubleshooter, he turned around failing building sites, showcasing his problem-solving skills. Mark also gained experience in the Solar Energy Industry, a sector he firmly believes could solve the majority of the UK's energy issues. He remains surprised at the lack of widespread adoption of solar energy in the country. Mark Ashdown holds strong views on the current state of leadership in the UK. He believes both Labour and the Conservative parties are failing to provide the direction the country desperately needs. In his opinion, the focus has shifted from genuine leadership to simply securing re-election, leaving the nation in political stagnation. A staunch supporter of the NHS, Mark has seen the healthcare system in action through personal experiences with friends and family members. With relatives who have worked in the NHS, and others still employed within the system, he understands the dedication of NHS staff. However, Mark is aware of the inefficiencies and waste reported by those who supply the NHS. He believes these problems must be addressed before more taxpayer money is spent. Rather than placing blame on the hardworking staff, he sees the flaws within the system itself and advocates for essential reforms to ensure long-term sustainability. Mark is deeply concerned about the current state of the UK's armed services. He notes that the British army has diminished to such an extent that it could fit within Wembley Stadium-a scenario he finds unsustainable. Similarly, the Royal Navy is struggling due to recruitment issues, weakening the nation's global defense role. Mark believes this decline must be urgently addressed to maintain the UK's security and international presence. Mark has watched with frustration as the UK's infrastructure, especially the road network, has deteriorated. Once a symbol of efficiency and reliability, the country's roads are now poorly maintained. He attributes this decline to reduced government funding for local councils, which are now facing bankruptcy due to poor management and misplaced priorities. Mark calls for an end to the focus on \"woke\" agendas that add little value to public services, instead advocating for a return to well-managed, functional infrastructure. Mark Ashdown envisions a future where there is a level playing field for all citizens. He supports reducing taxes on hard-working individuals while imposing higher taxes on luxury goods. He strongly opposes unnecessary bureaucracy, the misuse of the asylum system, and the spread of \"woke\" ideologies that he believes detract from addressing real issues affecting the country.",

From his early days in Hodge Lea and Oldbrook to his current residence in Woburn Sands, David remains close to his small business, The POD 'The Pain of Discipline,' reflecting his strong work ethic and dedication. David's career highlights include a notable four-year tenure as an operational Prison Officer at HMP Woodhill, Milton Keynes' Category A high-security prison, where he spent two years on the CSC Unit. His commitment to discipline, accountability, and social responsibility has consistently guided his professional journey, including the establishment of his own business. As Jim Rohn famously said, David aims to avoid 'The Pain of Regret' through his disciplined approach. With exciting opportunities ahead, including a leading role in a feature film and continued business growth, David's decision to stand for Reform UK is driven by principle rather than convenience. His previous political engagements, such as supporting the 'Leave' campaign in 2016 and aiding Nigel Farage's narrative in the 2019 General Election, reflect his unwavering commitment to conviction and principle. David's support for Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party in 2019 was rooted in the belief that they would fulfill Brexit and lead the country towards a sovereign, liberal economy. However, the subsequent decline in performance and unmet promises led him to reassess his political stance. He now believes that Labour's focus on 'Woke' issues and the Conservatives' failure to meet their core voters' expectations have created a void that Reform UK is poised to fill. David Reilly stands with Reform UK as the only right-of-centre party genuinely committed to a patriotic libertarian stance. He critiques both Labour and Conservative parties for their failures, including issues like national debt, Brexit delivery, and immigration. David is confident that Reform UK's manifesto offers a compelling and positive vision, akin to the successful Canadian Reform Party of the 1980s. If elected as your MP, David pledges to prioritize representation and service over his business ambitions, utilizing his skills and attributes to serve you with authenticity and dedication.",

After completing her schooling, she began her career at Watts Industrial Tyres, where she quickly advanced to become one of the company's youngest managers at just 18. Her decision to leave Watts and become self-employed led her to join her family's chemical business, focusing on sales. This role allowed her to connect with people directly, a facet of her career she truly enjoyed. It was during this time that she met her future husband, a dairy farmer from Haversham. Together, Jane and her husband developed a notable portfolio of retail and wholesale customers eager to purchase fresh milk from his family's farm, which housed a herd of 250 Friesian dairy cattle. Their dedication to providing quality products and building strong customer relationships was instrumental in their success. In 2006, Jane and her family relocated to Spain, where they embraced a new culture and lifestyle. During this period, they focused on educating their two daughters, engaging in outdoor activities like horse riding, and participating in local amateur dramatics. This time abroad was invaluable for the family, providing cherished moments together. The family returned to the UK in 2012 to support their children as they began their university studies. Jane reintegrated into the workforce and took on various projects, including a part-time role with Home Instead Care, a charity dedicated to providing in-home care for the elderly. Her role involved networking with local and national charities, such as MK Bus Shelter, MK Act, The Moran Centre, and Scots Bowls Club, to offer support and guidance to the elderly. This work proved to be profoundly rewarding and fueled her passion for addressing local issues affecting the elderly. Jane's firsthand experience with elderly care and local community concerns ignited her interest in politics. Driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact, she became actively involved in political efforts aimed at improving the lives of the elderly and addressing local issues.",

Lymington Hospital's perpetual staffing shortages further underscore the strain on medical services. The economic landscape presents its own set of challenges, with dwindling employment opportunities constraining the prospects for young people.

    "biography": "James Milmine believes that democracy functions optimally when voters are presented with real choices and when the parties in power are committed to fulfilling their promises. Unfortunately, the Labour and Conservative parties have repeatedly demonstrated a disconnect between their promises and their actions. Their failure to deliver on their pledges is compounded by an electoral system that perpetuates their dominance, leaving the electorate feeling disenfranchised. The current system prioritizes maintaining the status quo of these two major parties, who are primarily concerned with retaining power at any cost. This has led to a narrative where voting for smaller parties is dismissed as a \"wasted vote,\" signaling a deeper issue within our electoral framework. Milmine argues that this system is fundamentally flawed and demands comprehensive reform to ensure that every vote has meaningful impact. In the Sevenoaks area, frustration is growing due to the government's failure to address key issues such as road safety, accessible healthcare, and reliable public transportation. Instead, the focus appears to be on less pressing matters like banning certain dog breeds and smoking. Additionally, the burden of policies like ULEZ, LTN, and rising fuel duties disproportionately affects those who depend on their vehicles for essential work. Milmine is deeply concerned about the multiple crises facing the nation, including energy, housing, immigration, health, and economic challenges. He criticizes the current leadership for exacerbating these issues and believes that the party responsible for the financial collapse 14 years ago is not suited to fix these problems. Reform UK, according to Milmine, represents a genuine alternative. He aligns with Albert Einstein's view that repeating the same actions and expecting different results is irrational. Milmine believes Reform UK's focus on pragmatic solutions and common sense can address major issues such as road maintenance, healthcare waiting times, affordable housing, crime reduction, and economic revitalization. With 16 years of experience as a pilot in the RAF, Milmine has lived and worked across England, Scotland, and Wales, strengthening his commitment to the Union. He is passionate about preserving the unity of the UK and is dedicated to representing the hardworking people of the Sevenoaks constituency. Milmine is prepared to bring his resilience and determination to the forefront of his efforts to mend a fractured country.",

By raising the tax threshold to \u00a320,000, individuals in low-paid employment would see immediate financial relief. Additionally, reducing VAT on energy bills and lowering fuel duty would help to curb inflation, providing economic benefits to both consumers and businesses. Lowering corporation tax from its current 25% would make the UK more attractive to foreign investment and manufacturing, fostering a more stable and prosperous future. Edwards advocates for a modernized immigration system that selects individuals based on their potential contribution to the nation. A system requiring valid health insurance and specific employment skills would ensure that newcomers are well-prepared to contribute effectively. This approach contrasts sharply with current practices, highlighting Reform UK's commitment to a pragmatic immigration policy. John Edwards stands firmly behind Reform UK's robust plan to address illegal migration. Unlike the Conservatives, who have failed to act decisively, or Labour, which has agreed with Brussels to fly migrants into the UK, Reform UK is dedicated to stopping illegal crossings and returning individuals to France. Edwards supports the strategic reduction of foreign aid to focus on rebuilding essential public services that have suffered from chronic underfunding. Redirecting these resources would help restore and enhance critical services for the benefit of all citizens. Reform UK's vision for the NHS includes redistributing finances to improve the training and retention of doctors. Edwards believes that eliminating wasteful management roles, such as diversity and equality officers, would free up funds for patient care. Reform UK envisions a unified nation where healthcare reform removes unnecessary barriers, such as degree entry for nurses, to attract more individuals into the profession. John Edwards supports the development of an affordable and integrated transport system to reduce road congestion and pollution. He believes that petrol and diesel vehicles should remain in use until viable alternatives are fully developed and available. Edwards is committed to rebuilding the UK's armed forces, which have been diminished to dangerously low levels under successive Tory governments. Reform UK aims to restore the military's capability to effectively address overseas threats and safeguard national security.",

His diverse socio-economic background has significantly influenced his advocacy for individual liberties, personal responsibility, and limited government intervention. Jamie holds an Engineering degree and, for many years, focused primarily on his profession without much interest in politics. His political awareness was sparked by the Brexit debate, which highlighted the government's handling of complex issues and inspired him to explore political philosophy. Jamie's intellectual journey led him to study the works of notable thinkers such as Ludwig von Mises, Thomas Sowell, Ron Paul, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman. These studies have reinforced his belief in the foundational role of free markets and individual freedoms in fostering a prosperous society. Upon graduating, Jamie began his career as a consultant engineer, where he encountered the regulatory challenges that businesses face. This professional experience fueled his advocacy for deregulation and economic liberalization. Jamie's entry into politics was motivated by a desire to address what he perceives as excessive government interference in citizens' lives and economic activities, a concern highlighted by the events of 2020. He first engaged in the political arena by running for local council elections. In 2023, Jamie stood for Reform UK, drawn by the party's commitment to challenging the status quo and its positions on Brexit and mass immigration. He is now campaigning as a parliamentary candidate, aiming to represent his libertarian principles on a national level.

On social issues, he remains a strong defender of civil liberties, supporting policies that safeguard freedom of speech, privacy rights, and individual autonomy. With his unique blend of professional experience and libertarian principles, Jamie Pullin stands out as a transformative candidate within Reform UK. His vision for a leaner, more responsive government resonates with voters who are increasingly disillusioned with traditional political options. Jamie is not just a candidate but a representative of a movement advocating for a freer, more prosperous Britain.",

Her firsthand experience with the challenges of working life fuels her commitment to ensuring that work is truly rewarding. Erin believes that decisions made by the government should prioritize the needs and realities of working families. Frustrated by leaders who lack real-world experience and understanding of everyday struggles, Erin decided to step up and represent the working class. She is motivated by a desire to advocate for policies that reflect the experiences of ordinary people, aiming to bring a fresh and relatable perspective to the political arena. Erin is passionate about rekindling the UK's tradition of innovation and self-sufficiency. She emphasizes the need to support British farmers and source locally to reduce dependence on imports. This approach not only has the potential to cut costs and create jobs but also helps lower our carbon footprint by minimizing overseas transport. Investing in domestic resources is crucial for a sustainable future. The current reliance on foreign energy sources is untenable, Erin argues. With energy bills soaring, families should not have to choose between basic necessities. Erin advocates for utilizing domestic gas and oil resources to reduce reliance on foreign energy, lower costs, and create more jobs within the UK. This practical solution aims to address both economic and environmental concerns. Erin questions the necessity of compulsory BBC licensing fees when other media services operate on a voluntary subscription basis. She argues that the BBC, which is not an essential service, should explore alternative funding methods such as advertising, similar to other channels. Erin acknowledges that tax is a contentious issue but emphasizes its importance in shaping public services and personal finances. Despite a significant increase in minimum wage, the tax-free threshold remains unchanged, leading to higher effective tax rates. Erin supports raising the tax-free threshold to \u00a320,000 and adjusting tax bands to provide more relief. This change would offer substantial savings for the average UK worker and enhance overall fairness in the tax system.",

    "biography": "Neill Walker has lived and worked in Newcastle-Under-Lyme for many years, witnessing both its growth and challenges. His connection to the area began at the age of 16 through the Youth Training Scheme (YTS), where he acquired practical skills, such as wiring a plug-an often overlooked but foundational skill. Although he has lived in various parts of the country, Neill and his family have always been drawn back to Newcastle-Under-Lyme. His son resides locally, and his granddaughters attend school in the area. With many friends and family members rooted in the community, Neill's passion for Staffordshire's heritage and people runs deep. Currently residing in Baldwins Gate, Neill serves as a parish councillor and Vice Chair for Whitmore. His involvement in local politics has revealed systemic challenges that need urgent attention. Frustrated by the lack of accountability, transparency, and proactive efforts from local government, the Environment Agency, and Highways, Neill is determined to address these issues head-on. Neill's vision for local councils centers on increasing accountability and transparency. He aims to scrutinize the use of taxpayers' money, ensuring that every expenditure is justified and serves the community's best interests. To achieve this, Neill proposes regular meetings between portfolio heads and the executive team, where the state of the council and its services can be openly discussed and reviewed. He also advocates for bringing services back to the local level instead of outsourcing them to distant offices. This approach would create well-paid local jobs and ensure that council funds are allocated more effectively, fostering a greater sense of responsibility. Neill believes in empowering the public to challenge their councils openly, particularly concerning planning decisions. He understands the ongoing battle to protect green spaces and emphasizes that brownfield sites should be prioritized for development. The actions of the Environment Agency regarding Walley Quarry have raised significant concerns for Neill. He identifies a lack of transparency in their decision-making processes and stresses the urgent need for reform. Similarly, the local highways system is plagued by potholes, dangerous pavements, and malfunctioning traffic lights. Neill advocates for streamlining operations and prioritizing local teams to address these issues effectively, creating a safer and more efficient transport network for the community. Neill recognizes that the high street in Newcastle-Under-Lyme has seen a decline in recent years, with the loss of independent retailers and a decrease in footfall. To reverse this trend, he proposes reducing business rates and implementing a charge on online stores to support local businesses. By doing so, he hopes to encourage the return of independent retailers and increase foot traffic, creating a vibrant town centre with more places to eat, drink, and shop. Neill envisions a revitalized Iron Market, transforming it from an eyesore back into a bustling hub of activity and commerce. Neill Walker's commitment to Newcastle-Under-Lyme is unwavering. With a clear vision for reform in local councils, quangos, and taxation, he is ready to enact meaningful change and serve the community he loves.",

    "biography": "Meet Andrew Dye, your Reform UK candidate for North Herefordshire in the upcoming General Election. With a robust background in the military, engineering, and farming, Andrew Dye brings a wealth of experience and a deep commitment to his country and its values. Andrew hails from a family with strong roots in the military and engineering sectors, as well as farming. As a former Paratrooper, he is fiercely proud of Britain, its history, culture, and achievements. After serving 10 years in the Army, Andrew and his wife spent several years in Australia before returning home in 2013. They have since owned and operated an air conditioning company, a window manufacturing business, and renovated several properties. Andrew has taken on this role with Reform UK because he believes the current political priorities do not reflect the true interests of the British people. He criticizes the self-styled \"urban elites\" who, he argues, indulge in naive fantasies and luxury beliefs, disconnected from the realities faced by hardworking citizens. Andrew's philosophy is straightforward: he believes in serving his constituents, minimizing government interference, and fostering the entrepreneurial spirit that he sees as the foundation of a thriving democracy. He argues that the current political consensus amounts to taxation without representation and fails to respect the hard work and contributions of ordinary Britons. Andrew is passionate about improving society, ensuring that the elderly are respected and cared for, and providing young people with greater opportunities. He advocates for first-class education that encourages free thought rather than indoctrination. He believes in the right to own a home, a car, a business, to travel, and to have a family, without being forced into lesser lives by policies addressing what he sees as a non-existent climate crisis. He criticizes the governance since 1997, arguing that both Labour and the Conservatives have failed to utilize the ingenuity, creativity, and productivity of the British people. He condemns the current Conservative government for economic mismanagement, resulting in runaway inflation and increased taxation that devalues earnings and assets. He also denounces both major parties for their immigration policies and the perceived neglect of national security. Andrew believes that the current energy policies, particularly those aimed at achieving Net Zero, are scientifically illiterate, economically disastrous, and a significant act of national self-harm. He asserts that only Reform UK has the courage to end these policies and support the nation's energy security and manufacturing capabilities. Reform UK, according to Andrew, is the only party that truly believes in Britain and offers a comprehensive plan to reverse the damage done by successive governments. Their policies aim to cut taxes, reform the NHS, and eliminate government waste, putting money back into the pockets of the British people. They are committed to supporting British farmers, maintaining family ownership of farms, and ensuring that British produce is prioritized. Andrew Dye urges the people of North Herefordshire to support Reform UK, emphasizing that the party stands for a free, proud, and independent Britain. He calls for an end to the governance by careerist, globalist politicians and invites voters to join Reform UK in making Britain great again.",

    "biography": "Mark Whittle, born in Hartlepool in 1960, embarked on his journey in Fine Art at Nottingham before relocating to Ellesmere, Shropshire. His career began with Shropshire Museum Services. In 1984, Whittle joined the Territorial Army in Oswestry, serving in both the TA and regular Army. His service included deployments to the Falklands, Bosnia, and Kosovo, concluding in 2006. Over the years, Whittle has resided in Ellesmere, Oswestry, and Market Drayton. Whittle's dedication to politics and community development stems from a deep-seated desire to enhance his local area. For the past decade, he has contributed to the NHS Ambulance service. An avid Rugby Union supporter, Whittle has played for the Oswestry First and Second Teams, as well as the Army Sevens team. In 2007, Whittle joined the Market Drayton Town Council, where he served as Mayor on two separate occasions. He was an active member of the Shropshire Association of Councils (SALC) in Wem, including a term as chairman. Through his roles, Whittle has gained valuable insights into local issues and has been instrumental in addressing problems within the community. His passion for North Shropshire drives his commitment to resolving longstanding issues within the constituency. Mr Whittle, a full time Ambulance driver and military veteran of 20 years service, is a former mayor of the town in the constituency who joined Reform UK having met the Conservative candidate campaigning. Mr Whittle said, \"As Chairman of the Market Drayton Conservative Party and member of Shropshire Conservative executive, this is the most difficult decision I have ever made. Made only after a great deal of soul searching. \"I'm faced with no choice how I, how can I possibly back a candidate from Birmingham who has zero knowledge of North Shropshire and the challenges our community faces. It is too late for him to relocate to Shropshire if he wins. The Conservatives should have selected locally rather than be pressured into supporting someone with no prior interest or knowledge of the area. \"She highlights concerns over health locally and worsening local NHS provision. She is a champion of and supporter of our small businesses and farming communities in Shropshire. She is prepared to fight for the desperately overdue reforms to our local infrastructure, including lack of both east-west and north-south transport links. \"Kirsty is a local Shropshire lass who has great integrity. Kirsty has lived in North Shropshire all her life and currently lives in the heart of the county, Wem. The family business was based in Oswestry and her extended family is involved in Shropshire farming. \"Kirsty is streets ahead of both the Conservative and all the other candidates currently standing. The people of Market Drayton and North Shropshire both need and deserve an MP who understands, listens and acts on their concerns with both passion and energy. She is a breath of fresh air. She understands Shropshire. And its future needs\".",

    "biography": "Rob Howard was born in Coventry in 1958. He lived there until he was 8 years old when the family moved to the South Coast for work reasons. Rob lived there until he was 18 when he started full-time work for The Dunlop Sports Company. Rob wanted a career in Sales and Marketing and at age 20 secured a sales position with Mars Confectionery for whom he worked for 7 years. Rob then moved onto the Managerial ladder with various companies and made his way up through Area Sales Manager, Regional Sales Manager, National Sales Manager, Sales Director, Sales and Marketing Director to eventually become Managing Director of a \u00a35m business which he helped grow to \u00a310m in the space of 5 years. During this time Rob Howard got married, had four children and moved a further six times to accommodate his job requirements. This eventually took its toll out of his personal life which resulted in Rob splitting up with his wife. When he reflected, too much time working was to blame which prompted the next phase of Rob's life. At 45 Rob Howard decided to leave the employed world and set up his own business consultancy, helping SME's overcome their sales challenges. This introduced Rob to a wide range of differing businesses and services which broadened his commercial knowledge. During this set up time Rob met his now partner of 20 years, Claire, who he moved in with and have been with ever since. Rob & Claire have lived on the Maple Park Estate in Nuneaton for all this time. The Covid pandemic put pay to Rob Howards business, as no company could continue to use his services whilst the lockdown was in place. Rob closed his company in 2022 but was then fortunate to find a part time consultancy role at the tender age of 63. Being a part time position, it allows Rob to devote the much needed time in planning the General Election campaign for Reform UK. Rob Howard's personal life consists of being Captain of a Golf Society based in Attleborough. During his tenure Rob has orchestrated the raising of several thousands of pounds for good causes including the charity Georgies Gift and the purchase of a defibrillator which sits in The Fox public House in Attleborough. Rob's continuation of this role is now dependent on a condition he has acquired called Lymphoedema which is where your Lymph nodes stop working or malfunction leaving you with swollen limbs, in Rob's case, his legs and feet. This in turn is affecting his mobility. Rob does enjoy a good conversation and socialising with friends but he does get told to pipe down when the subject of politics comes up! Rob enjoys 80's music but keeps in touch with modern trends. Rob likes to cook and enjoys trying new Indian and Chinese recipes. Rob Howard believes the biggest challenge facing Nuneaton is how the vast amounts of new people we will have around the town in the new housing developments will be comfortably accommodated. There is no doubt that immigration is high on the list of UK concerns and Nuneaton will end up with its fair share until something is done about regulating the tide of incomers. It is Rob's concern that we will be under-resourced for Policing, Schooling, Medical Care and general council-based services not to mention how all these extra people will be able to travel around an already strangled town road network. All these matters should be dealt with whilst this unprecedented growth in the population is happening. Recently Rob Howard has read about a number of the promises to inject life back into the Town Centre which have either been stopped or delayed. This shouldn't be allowed to happen and Rob says he will do all in his power to find out what has changed and to do what he can to reinstitute the plans. A vote for Reform UK is a common-sense vote. It is providing a new party the opportunity to deal with all the matters the public are concerned about that the current incumbent Government and the unreliable party \"in waiting\" is not interested in. VOTE REFORM UK. For more information on Rob Howard or Reform UK please contact me by email or on social media.

    "biography": "Dave Poole, a dedicated candidate for Staffordshire Moorlands with Reform UK, faced significant challenges in his early years. Leaving school in the mid-1980s, he entered the workforce during a period of economic decline and industrial struggle in rural Cheshire. Despite the Conservative government's efforts under Margaret Thatcher to stabilize the nation, the impact did not reach the outskirts of Cheshire. Initially involved in youth training schemes as a welder and vehicle technician, Dave transitioned into the burgeoning mobile phone repair industry. With limited formal training, he taught himself the necessary skills and spent years working with The Caudwell Group at their technical facility, \"The Mobile Phone Repair Company.\" His career later included roles at D2D and Celestica UK, where he handled repairs for major manufacturers like NEC, Motorola, and Orbitel. Eventually, disillusioned by the industry's corporate shift, Dave returned to his family's trade in vehicle breakdown and recovery. In 2008, Dave invested in his first truck, gradually expanding his business to operate 15 vehicles in the Cheshire/Staffordshire areas. His growth is a testament to his hard work and dedication, achieved without seeking financial aid from banks, even during the pandemic. During this challenging period, Dave maintained full employment for his staff, foregoing his own wages and avoiding furloughs. Dave married his long-time partner, Julie, in 1998, and they have a son together. Julie's unwavering support and grounding presence have been crucial to Dave's personal and professional life. They share a light-hearted agreement: for every classic car Dave acquires, Julie gets a new cat! His political awakening came during a drive to Africa when he read about local council issues in Private Eye magazine. Enraged by the frequent mentions of his local council in the \"Rotten Boroughs\" section, Dave delved into studying local and national government, leading him to feel compelled to engage actively in politics. Dave's first attempt at local town council elections was met with significant resistance, including manipulated social media campaigns and unfair tactics. Despite these challenges, he secured second place. Undeterred, Dave participated in a subsequent by-election and won, triumphing over the Labour candidate by 17 votes-a David versus Goliath scenario with his small team facing a large Labour machine. More recently, he came within 57 votes of defeating the Cheshire East Council leader in an all-out election, reflecting his rapid rise in politics. Having experienced various successes in town council elections, Dave is now focused on addressing the pressing need for reform at both local and national levels. He believes that the current state of central government requires substantial changes, which neither Labour nor Conservative parties seem willing to address. Dave is critical of over-regulated industries, including agriculture, engineering, and manufacturing, which he believes are harming the economy and reducing prosperity for everyone. He also highlights deficiencies in our law and justice institutions, educational standards, and the neglect of historical education as crucial issues that need urgent attention. Dave Poole invites you to share your thoughts, experiences, and frustrations regarding the current political landscape. He is committed to addressing the issues affecting our lives and believes that voting for him will be a vote for a return to common sense.

    "biography": "Michael Bailey's political journey began in 1997 when he was selected as the Referendum candidate for Stoke South, although he ultimately did not stand. At that time, he was residing in Fenton. Following this period, Michael focused on his business and family. Despite accepting the democratic decision to remain in the European Union, he had always wished for the UK to exit. His frustration with the Tory Party's failure to honor its referendum promises led him to become active with the Brexit Party, which later evolved into the Reform Party. Initially reluctant to stand for election, Michael Bailey was persuaded by fellow campaigners to fight for the sovereignty of the nation. He is deeply concerned about the current levels of immigration and the strain it places on the UK's services and infrastructure. He believes that the focus should shift from increasing the population solely for economic gain to enhancing the quality of life and making better use of existing resources. Michael advocates for a comprehensive overhaul of the education system and aims to achieve technical excellence in the UK's manufacturing sectors. His commitment to improving these areas is a core part of his political platform. Though not originally from Potteries, Michael Bailey has strong connections to Stoke. Born and raised in Whitchurch, he has fond memories of visiting the Potteries with his family to purchase crockery and second-hand furniture. Michael joined the Royal Air Force in 1979 and served until 1987, after which he settled in Stafford and later Fenton. He has worked in various roles, including with a refrigeration company in Hanley and an Air Handling Unit manufacturer in Stoke, before becoming self-employed. With over 35 years of experience running his own business, Michael has also engaged in local sports and holds an Instructor and Ground Examiner rating in Microlight flying. Michael no longer resides in Stoke due to frequent crime affecting his business premises and vehicle. He moved to a countryside setting outside Eccleshall but maintains a strong connection to Stoke, considering himself an adopted son of the city. He is committed to serving the people of South Stoke and aims to address the drug problems in the area if elected. Michael Bailey's motivation for running for Parliament is to ensure that his grandchildren enjoy the same freedoms and safety he experienced growing up. He advocates for a smaller government, reduced interference in daily lives, and an end to the criminalization of motorists and educational indoctrination. He is concerned about the notion of global governance and seeks to end the constant fear-mongering from various institutions. Michael believes that people should be treated as responsible adults capable of independent thought and should not be governed by division and fear. He calls for patriotic leaders who prioritize the nation's well-being over self-interest, expressing concern for the future of Western civilization until such leaders are in place.",

    "biography": "Mark Hoath, a resident of Sutton Coldfield for over 45 years, has witnessed the steady decline of the so-called 'Royal Town'-particularly disheartening over the last two decades. As someone deeply invested in the community, Hoath is frustrated by the erosion of local amenities and the deterioration of the town's charm. For the past 23 years, Andrew Mitchell has served as Sutton Coldfield's MP. During this time, the town center has faced severe neglect, with the closure of the Magistrates' Court, the Registry Office, and an impending closure of the local police station. Despite earning \u00a3182,000 annually from consultancy work in addition to his MP salary of around \u00a382,000 (figures reported in 2021), Mitchell's efforts to address local issues have been lackluster. The controversy surrounding \"Plebgate\" in 2014 (Reference 2) further tarnished his political career. While Mitchell has been actively involved in international development, focusing on poverty reduction in Africa, he has shown less concern for the rising poverty levels in Sutton Coldfield (Reference 3). The local Labour-controlled Birmingham City Council has consistently underfunded Sutton Coldfield and recently declared itself bankrupt by issuing a section 114 notice. Crime rates in Sutton Coldfield, particularly shoplifting, have surged to epidemic levels. At present, Mark Hoath is the only declared Prospective Parliamentary Candidate who permanently resides in Sutton Coldfield. If elected, Hoath pledges to dedicate himself fully to rebuilding the town, without engaging in secondary jobs, regardless of potential earnings. Hoath supports Reform UK's plan to cut business taxes, which he believes would significantly benefit local businesses, invigorate shopping areas, and attract more visitors. Additionally, he is committed to increasing the number of police officers on the streets, with Reform UK's promise to hire 40,000 extra officers nationwide over five years. Hoath's commitment to raising the personal tax threshold to \u00a320,000 would provide substantial benefits to lower-income residents, allowing them to spend more locally. Hoath firmly believes that only a dedicated local advocate can drive the necessary regeneration of Sutton Coldfield, ensuring it receives the revitalization it rightfully deserves.",

With a strong background in local politics, she has previously stood in three Walsall Council local elections, demonstrating her commitment to public service and the people of her community. Elaine Williams is honored to have been selected as the candidate for Walsall and Bloxwich in the upcoming general election. Her passion lies in ensuring that politicians work for the benefit of the people, not the other way around. Elaine Williams believes in putting the needs of the community first and is dedicated to advocating for the residents of Walsall and Bloxwich. Elaine Williams and her team have been actively campaigning in the area, engaging with residents and sharing the vision of Reform UK. With local support growing rapidly, she is eager to meet even more people in the coming weeks. Elaine Williams believes that many are ready for change and looks forward to continuing the conversation with her constituents. Elaine Williams invites those who want to be part of the movement to reach out and get involved with the campaign. She believes that by working together, the people of Walsall and Bloxwich can make a difference and bring about meaningful change. I am a solicitor and I care passionately about our people and our quality of life. My key priorities for our region are employment, health, wellbeing and social care, transport, crime, the environment, and you. Local businesses are being severely affected by the introduction of 'Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes', 'Clean Air Zones', imposed road closures and arbitrary traffic restrictions, all of which reduce public access to their businesses. These schemes also make travel around our towns and cities unnecessarily difficult. I will change these detrimental measures, invest in our town centres and revitalise our high streets to allow our businesses to flourish and thrive, and seek to encourage more businesses to invest in the West Midlands. Much is spoken about the drive to Net Zero and the negative impact of pollution on the environment. Energy policies pursued across the region are making everyone poorer and colder as a result of soaring fuel prices and green energy levies. inflating our energy costs. West Midlands water companies discharged untreated sewage into our waterways over 60,000 times during 2023, a 54% increase in the number of sewage spills over 2020-2022. Measures must be taken to stop this practice, clean up our rivers and waterways and prosecute offenders. Excessive shareholder profit-taking must be stopped, and the money invested into reducing leaks, developing the water infrastructure, and combating pollution. As predicted, HS2 has proved to be the white elephant we all thought it would be. It was heralded as the stimulus for transport and travel in the West Midlands, but has failed to deliver any tangible benefits, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation to the countryside in its wake. Instead of vanity projects, we need a complete rethink on travel to deliver a fully integrated, efficient, safer and more effective transport system for the West Midlands. Crime is on the increase, particularly violent crime, with the West Midlands being one of the highest crime areas in the country. More measures are needed, as well as an increase in police officers on the ground. Working in partnership with the seven local authorities and the Police and Crime Commissioner, I will bid for additional funding to address these urgent needs. Levels of care and access to services should be equally available to all. One of the most pressing issues is mental health, where levels of service and support vary dramatically across the region. I want to ensure that everyone has access to the services they need, including GP Practices. I will work closely with the NHS and Social Care providers to make this a reality. There are too many homes in the region where significant repairs are outstanding, and many properties are affected by black mould and other environmental health threats. I will introduce stringent checks to ensure that existing tenants are living in decent accommodation, and work with Housing Associations to build more affordable homes. There are many former brownfield industrial sites that can be recovered for housing, reducing the need to build on Green Belt land. I will also work with industry to repurpose buildings that are no longer in use, which can be converted into housing accommodation and training centres for the homeless and our service veterans. If elected as your mayor, your hopes, your needs, and your concerns will be my highest priorities. I will act in the best interests of everyone living in the West Midlands Combined Authority region.",

    "biography": "Vote for me and from the get-go if elected I'll ensure you have safe access to a properly staffed surgery to field the concerns of business and of residents and to help find practical solutions. Whether it's backing the Barrow Waterfront proposal, affordable housing initiatives or industrial enterprise I'll always argue major investments must prioritise local jobs and families or at least make parallel provision for local needs. Grandstanding on the floor of the Commons is no doubt an effective and very visible virtue, but doing the hard yards in the lobbies, backrooms and committees to push forward the Reform UK agenda is how I hope to secure lasting change. I've never in my life been a member of any political party, but I'm inviting you now to trust me, to hold firm and keep the faith when you enter the polling booth. I was born in 1957, raised in London and schooled in Hertfordshire, then studied law at the University of London's School of Oriental & African Studies before heading north of the border for a postgraduate degree in oil, gas and Law of the Sea. I cut my teeth reporting on the North Sea bonanza and stayed with journalism for most of my professional life, detouring for a seven year stint in PR and government relations in Vienna, initially for the Opec Secretariat and then for the Opec finance ministers. I've exhibited, researched and travelled close to the ground in the Middle East, China, South Asia and Afghanistan, acquired a strong understanding of how the real world works and why the UK must change the way it does business and engages other nations. I have lived and worked in three European countries and for a quarter century was based in Accra, Ghana, reporting throughout sub-Saharan Africa on the upstream oil and gas industry, African energy and geopolitics. I now live in Copeland with my family including a secondary school age daughter and see every day the challenges faced by our Cumbrian communities, many of which are replicated nationwide. Conditions are nothing short of a disgrace. Retroactive aid and generous remedial provision must be offered to all vets and their dependents with full and seamless medical, rehabilitation and social support, from re-training through to fees-paid higher education for illegals and overstayers are intercepted, detained and whisked away for offshore processing and deportation, currently underestimated at 1.3 million souls, on one of many uninhabited islands in our Overseas Territories. A root & branch overhaul of local government and the Civil Service is long overdue; the judicial system, the criminal justice system, the prisons and police 'service' are all underfunded, all in crisis, overburdened with non-jobs and have lost public confidence. Ditch the renewables tax grab and let's wrap up this whole demented Net Zero distraction - Better we act decisively now to restore the fortunes of the UK's world class oil and gas industry, embracing also our ample reserves of helium and hydrogen, Reform will revisit the region's fracking and coalbed methane potential, incentivise exploration in the East Irish Sea and get that untapped gas ashore, shoring up the relevance of our Rampside Terminal for future generations. I will press for the immediate suspension of the Equalities Act, to expunge from these shores all reference to the divisive antiphrastic diktat of diversity, equity and inclusion. Reform will excise the European Convention on Human Rights and the so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards from our national life.",

At the age of 56, Moffitt, who previously left school at 16 to join the Army as a boy soldier, finds himself embarking on a new career in politics. His distinguished eight-year tenure as a Royal Military Policeman, serving in various regions including BAOR, the Falkland Islands post-conflict, and Northern Ireland, laid a strong foundation for his future endeavors. Following his military service, Moffitt enjoyed a successful career in corporate roles around Manchester and eventually transitioned to entrepreneurship with his wife, achieving moderate success in their business ventures. As a veteran, Lee Moffitt is disillusioned with the current political landscape, characterized by career politicians who often speak in vague terms and fail to address the core issues. He is frustrated with politicians who have never experienced a \"normal\" job and seem to prioritize personal gain over public service. This dissatisfaction is driven by witnessing a cycle of ineffective governance where political parties exchange control but fail to enact meaningful change. Moffitt's commitment to reform stems from a desire to break this cycle and address critical issues such as uncontrolled immigration, a failing healthcare system, national security, and the cost-of-living crisis. Moffitt argues that the current 'Tribal' first-past-the-post voting system is flawed, reinforcing a two-party system reminiscent of Belarus, which undermines true democracy. He advocates for proportional representation to ensure that every vote counts and to provide voters with genuine alternatives. Moffitt believes that the ruling parties' resistance to proportional representation serves their interests and perpetuates the status quo, which he views as detrimental to effective governance. Lee Moffitt is passionate about offering a real choice for voters disillusioned with the existing political options. He asserts that the upcoming elections are a pivotal moment for the country, where every vote is crucial. Moffitt encourages voters to support Reform, positioning it as a genuine alternative to the traditional parties, which he criticizes as offering only incremental changes. He believes that a vote for Reform represents a commitment to meaningful change and a step towards real democracy. In summary, Lee Moffitt's political campaign is driven by a deep commitment to reform and a desire to provide a genuine alternative to the current political system. He urges voters to consider the benefits of proportional representation and to support a party that challenges the status quo. Moffitt's unique perspective as a veteran and successful entrepreneur informs his vision for a more accountable and effective government.",

Having lived in the Hyndburn constituency for over 30 years, Richard Oakley has deep roots in the community. Though currently between jobs and a bachelor, his political experience is extensive. Oakley previously aligned with the Tory Party during its earlier conservative days, standing in local elections from 1990-1992 and for Lancashire County Council in 1993.

Recognizing the urgent need for change, Alex has embraced the role of Reform UK's parliamentary candidate for Knowsley, determined to champion the issues that matter most to the local community. Alex proposes to introduce fair and compassionate immigration policies that welcome skilled individuals who can contribute to society, while providing refuge for those genuinely seeking asylum. Regaining control over borders and tackling illegal migration, including holding accountable those who facilitate it, is central to his plan. In a call to break free from the traditional two-party system, Alex supports the introduction of proportional representation. This change aims to ensure that every citizen's voice is heard and that the government remains accountable to the people. The impact of lockdowns and COVID-19 has exacerbated a mental health crisis, especially among the youth. Alex aims to address the long waiting times for critical mental health services, which are causing additional strain on both individuals and societal systems. With the highest individual tax burden in seventy years, Alex advocates for cutting public sector waste, streamlining bureaucratic processes, and eliminating unproductive roles. This approach aims to restore focus on delivering high-quality front-line services. To achieve energy self-sufficiency, Alex emphasizes the need to fully utilize natural oil and gas reserves, support nuclear technology, and reconsider subsidies for \"green\" technologies. This strategy is intended to shield Great Britain from global political instability and reduce the financial strain on households. Alex has a long-standing commitment to preserving Knowsley's green spaces and advocating for environmental issues. He supports sustainable environmental policies that balance the need for ecological preservation with economic realities.

    "biography": "Matthew Moody was born and raised in Yorkshire, where he grew up as the son of a dedicated policeman and a caring housewife. His upbringing instilled in him a strong sense of right and wrong, which was reinforced by his early passions for rugby league, the English language, and the Royal Air Force (RAF). His childhood also included many family walks on the hills, a favorite activity of his parents that gave him a lifelong appreciation for the outdoors. Matthew pursued his higher education at Oxford University, where he studied Theology. After completing his studies, he transitioned into the business world, primarily focusing on the travel and leisure sectors. Throughout his career, he gained extensive experience and built a solid foundation in business management before deciding to venture into entrepreneurship. He established his own business in real estate and marketing, where he applied his skills and knowledge to grow a successful enterprise. In 2022, Matthew relocated to Cumbria after being selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for Penrith and the Border, now known as Penrith and Solway. His commitment to addressing the issues faced by his community led him to step up as the candidate for Reform UK. He is driven by a desire to implement a common-sense, unified approach to politics and management, aimed at righting the wrongs perpetuated by successive governments. As Reform UK's PPC, Matthew has been at the forefront of the party's efforts in Cumbria, organizing well-attended meetings across the constituency, including in Penrith, Alston, and Keswick. His leadership was evident when he and the Regional Manager for Cumbria arranged for Richard Tice to visit Penrith on January 15th, 2024. The event drew a record crowd eager to learn about how Reform UK's policies can transform the country and make Britain great again. The event was widely covered in local media, including the News and Star and the Westmorland Herald. Penrith and Solway is a predominantly rural constituency facing numerous challenges, such as inadequate investment, poor infrastructure, and a lack of support from the central government. Farmers are struggling with reduced payments for land use, healthcare services are underfunded, public transport is unreliable, and the roads are riddled with potholes. Unemployment is rising, there is a shortage of affordable housing, and young people have few opportunities for a prosperous future. Matthew believes that these issues require urgent attention and decisive action. Matthew Moody is standing for Reform UK because he has witnessed the neglect of ordinary people by successive governments. He believes that it is time to stand up and demand change. His campaign is built on the principle that enough is enough, and it is time to restore fairness and opportunity to the people of Penrith and Solway. If you are frustrated with the current state of affairs and want to make a difference, Matthew encourages you to join the campaign. Your support can help bring about the change needed in Penrith and Solway. Volunteering your time and effort is a valuable contribution to the cause, and together, we can build a better future for everyone.",

    "biography": "Lee Anderson is a British politician and television presenter currently representing Ashfield as a Member of Parliament (MP). Originally elected as a Conservative MP in 2019, he switched allegiance to Reform UK in March 2024, after having the Conservative whip suspended. Anderson became Reform UK's first MP and was re-elected under the party's banner in the 2024 general election. Prior to his parliamentary career, he worked as a coal miner and for the Citizens Advice Bureau. He was previously involved with the Labour Party before joining the Conservatives in 2018. Lee Anderson, born on 6 January 1967 in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, grew up with his coal miner father and factory worker mother. He attended local schools and was active in Arthur Scargill's National Union of Mineworkers, campaigning for Labour in the 1983 election. Anderson worked as a coal miner for ten years, followed by a decade at Citizens Advice, before supporting homeless care leavers in hostels. Lee Anderson, a long-time Labour Party member, was elected as a Labour councillor in 2015 for Ashfield District's Huthwaite and Brierley ward. In February 2018, he was suspended by Labour after placing boulders to prevent Traveller communities from settling in the area. Following this, Anderson joined the Conservative Party in March 2018, citing dissatisfaction with Labour's shift to the hard left under Momentum. He later served as a Conservative councillor for Mansfield's Oakham ward from 2019 to 2021. On 11 March, Lee Anderson made headlines by joining Reform UK, becoming its first Member of Parliament. Despite previously criticizing the party and its leader, Richard Tice, Anderson's move marked a significant shift. In the 2024 general election, he was re-elected as MP for Ashfield with 42.8% of the vote, though his majority decreased to 5,509. Following the election, Anderson was appointed as Chief Whip of Reform UK. Lee Anderson, a prominent British politician and former Conservative MP, has announced his candidacy as the Reform UK candidate for the Ashfield constituency. Anderson's move to Reform UK reflects growing dissatisfaction among some members of the Conservative Party, particularly with regard to issues such as immigration, economic management, and governmental accountability. As a Reform UK candidate, Anderson is positioning himself as an advocate for political reform, stronger immigration control, and policies that prioritize the needs of ordinary British citizens. Lee Anderson is no stranger to politics or controversy. Elected as the Conservative MP for Ashfield in 2019, he quickly gained a reputation for his outspoken and often provocative views, especially on issues such as law and order, immigration, and welfare. His style resonated with many voters who were frustrated with what they saw as political correctness and a lack of genuine representation in Westminster. However, Anderson has also been a divisive figure, attracting criticism for some of his more blunt remarks. Despite his popularity with a segment of the electorate, Anderson became increasingly critical of the Conservative Party, especially on the handling of Brexit and immigration. He expressed frustration with what he perceived as the government's failure to fully deliver on the promises made during the Brexit referendum, including taking control of the UK's borders and reducing immigration. His decision to join Reform UK reflects these concerns, as the party continues to advocate for a stronger and more independent Britain. Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party, is focused on creating a more accountable government and delivering on the promises made during the Brexit campaign. The party advocates for a clean break from the European Union, a points-based immigration system, and lower taxes to stimulate economic growth. Anderson's candidacy under Reform UK's banner in Ashfield aligns with the party's broader goals of shaking up the political establishment and addressing the frustrations of ordinary voters. The Ashfield constituency, which includes towns such as Sutton-in-Ashfield and Kirkby-in-Ashfield, has traditionally been a Labour stronghold. However, in the 2019 election, Anderson helped secure a dramatic swing to the Conservatives, riding a wave of dissatisfaction with Labour's stance on Brexit and economic issues. Many voters in Ashfield supported Brexit, and there remains a strong sentiment that the benefits of leaving the EU have not been fully realized. Anderson's move to Reform UK taps into these sentiments, as he promises to deliver on the original Brexit vision and advocate for policies that will benefit local communities. As a Reform UK candidate, Anderson's platform will likely focus on several key issues that resonate with voters in Ashfield. One of his top priorities is immigration control. Anderson, like many in Reform UK, believes that the UK's immigration system is broken and that uncontrolled immigration is putting unsustainable pressure on public services, particularly in areas like healthcare, housing, and education. He argues that tighter immigration policies will help ensure that resources are available for those who need them most, especially in working-class communities like Ashfield. Economic reform is another central pillar of Anderson's platform. Ashfield, like many former industrial areas, has faced economic challenges, including job losses and stagnant wages. Anderson advocates for policies that will encourage business investment and create jobs, such as lowering taxes and reducing red tape. He also supports Reform UK's call for significant reforms to the welfare system, arguing that welfare should be a safety net rather than a long-term lifestyle choice. Lee Anderson's decision to run for Ashfield under the Reform UK banner signals a major shift in his political career and highlights the broader discontent among some voters with the traditional political parties. With a focus on stronger immigration control, economic reform, and governmental accountability, Anderson is positioning himself as a champion for the working-class communities of Ashfield. His candidacy will offer voters an alternative to both the Conservative and Labour parties, as he seeks to bring a new voice to Parliament and deliver on the promises that many feel have been neglected.",

    "biography": "Frank Ward was born in the East End of Glasgow and lived in various locations across England before settling in Retford. As the eldest son of a bread salesman, Frank began his career as an apprentice at a shipwright on the River Clyde, notably at the same shipyard where Billy Connolly trained. At just 17 years old, Frank enlisted in the Royal Marine Reserves. By the age of 18, he had earned his qualifications as a parachutist and became a green beret member of the Royal Marine Commandos. Frank Ward boasts nearly 25 years of experience as an elected borough councillor. Over his extensive career, he has held several key roles, including group leader, chairman of housing, council-appointed director of a housing association, chairman of a community association, and chair of school governors. In 2012, Frank joined UKIP and quickly ascended to the position of chairman of Hertsmere UKIP. He stood as a UKIP candidate for Parliament in 2015, securing one of the highest vote counts for the party and pushing the Liberal Democrats into fourth place. After relocating to Retford in 2016, Frank rejoined UKIP in Bassetlaw. Following the death of his wife, he authored a book on politics, published in 2022, before returning to the political arena with Reform UK. At the age of 86, Frank Ward is proud to be the Reform UK Parliamentary candidate for the Bassetlaw constituency, making him the oldest candidate in history to stand for Parliament in Westminster. His candidacy is driven by his concern for the elderly and infirm, who he believes are often overlooked by Westminster until election periods, despite being a reliable voting demographic. Additionally, Frank is dedicated to reforming the \"first past the post\" electoral system, advocating for Proportional Representation or the Single Transferable Vote-systems already used in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland for their devolved governments. Frank argues that if these systems are deemed equitable for devolved governments, they should also be considered for Westminster. Frank has begun campaigning in the Bassetlaw towns of Worksop and Retford on Saturday mornings. He invites residents to meet him and witness firsthand his commitment and political expertise aimed at addressing the needs of the community and challenging the insularity of Westminster politics.",

    "biography": "I am a fifty-six-year-old businessman from Chesterfield, married with one grown up son. I was born and bred in Sheffield and have working class roots, which I am proud of. It gave me a firm appreciation of the few things we have and taught me the value of a good honest day's work and getting stuck in, since we had little other choice. There is definitely no silver spoon element here. Everything we have in life is what my wife and I have worked hard for and continue to do so to this day. I have an interest in history and read quite widely. My early working years, between 1987 and 2004, were in finance. I worked for the Prudential Assurance Co, The Midland Bank/HSBC, and then two large accountancy practices in Sheffield servicing business clients. So while I do not claim to be an expert in any of these areas, I believe that those years gave me a decent look behind the scenes at how money works. I have an insight into the world of insurance, savings and investments, banking, accountancy, taxation and how businesses run in general. This is not bad groundwork for any aspiring politician, I guess, and one that gives me perhaps more experience than someone who has just popped out of university with a degree in rocket science. From 2004, I have been running my own vintage motorcycle business. It's a hobby gone mad for me and has been lots of fun. I have met some quite remarkable characters and learnt an awful lot about our automotive history. More importantly I have learnt from hard experience what it takes to survive in business. Being self-employed means you have no sick pay, no holiday pay, no pension plan or cushy benefits such as a company car, medical insurance or an annual Christmas bonus. If you make a mistake in business, you pay for it yourself. This translates to being able to work hard all month and some months finding yourself worse off financially than when you started. Have I had months where I've lost money? Absolutely, and when you're paying personally for waste or mistakes, you learn quick. When your own cash is on the line it is a fine master. It is something many employees never experience, and I feel do not perhaps fully appreciate. Business has also shown me the harsh reality of red tape, of accounts to be done, of VAT returns to be completed, of health and safety, of rates, bills and local government interference, etc. Frankly, small businesses are deluged with hassle. Making a profit is the least of it sometimes. So what have I seen during these last four decades working? Well, the 1987 stock market crash was up close and personal for me. I witnessed the Millennium bug scam unfold followed by the tech stock bubble bursting. I lived through the 2008 banking crises which triggered the recession and the 'austerity years' (have they finished?). We all lived through the surreal lockdowns of the pandemic and most recently the cost-of-living crisis, where everything seems to have doubled in price regardless of reason. It has all been a remarkable financial roller coaster. Working to survive can be hard enough, but when outside forces collude to make all our lives so much harder, I've found myself gnashing my teeth in frustration with everyone else. Which brings me nicely to politics Just like you, I'm sick and tired of powerlessly watching car-crash politics in the UK along with ambulance-chasing politicians who leap on the latest disaster to score some minor political point. I am tired of the weekly Punch and Judy show in Westminster where seemingly 'detached from reality' members score political points off each other across the dispatch box, while the world outside merrily goes to the dogs. I am tired of hearing about (and more pertinently paying for) London's problems or the seeing the country's sole reliance on the one great industry... the city/banking, etc. I am tired of seeing all the other industries being left to whither on the vine. Fishing has been parleyed off, farming is on its knees, mining has gone, steel has gone, shipbuilding has gone, the automotive industry has been sold off or is a shadow of its former self - industry of all types has been actively run down. Even the utilities and trains have been flogged off and run into the ground. We are now apparently just a 'service economy'. Politically, we have had people shouting at each other across the dispatch box in Westminster since Oliver Cromwell established the place in 1650. I have to ask in all seriousness, where has it actually got us? The industrial revolution did not start in Westminster, nor the age of empire, nor the age of remarkable technologies, and even in terms of law-making... how much further on are we than the Magna Carta? All of these started outside the M25 in that strange wider world known as Great Britain, which is where I would like to focus. It is time in my life to start giving a little back and I believe I can add a little value, for what it is worth. Like you, I am sick of not being listened too. I fall down the same potholes as you, pay the same taxes as you and struggle, like you, to survive. I am listening to your problems because I share them. Let's focus on local issues and build jobs and a brighter future here together. What I am seeing and hearing from Reform UK tackles many of these issues. Their policies make sense to me. Common sense. I would be pleased to bring my years of experience to bear on our shared difficulties and listen to your problems. I have my feet on the ground and my head is most definitely not in the clouds. I know that all our lives can be made much better now and I want to pass on a far brighter future to our kids than we are presently on track to do. I believe that it can be done and the choice to roll the dice and take that gamble will be yours come election day. You can choose the same old show or just maybe be brave and give the outsider a fighting chance for once. What have you got to lose? Another lost decade, or a real chance to start fixing the problems with a local representative you can relate too and is really listening.",

    "biography": "Richard Tice is a prominent British businessman and politician best known for his role as the leader of Reform UK, a political party formerly known as The Brexit Party. Under Tice's leadership, Reform UK has positioned itself as a key advocate for Brexit, national sovereignty, and economic reform, striving to reshape the political landscape of the United Kingdom. Richard Tice was born on September 13, 1964, and developed an early interest in business and finance. After completing his education at Uppingham School and the University of Salford, where he studied construction economics and quantity surveying, Tice embarked on a successful business career. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a high-profile property developer and businessman. Tice co-founded Quidnet Capital Partners, a property investment and development firm. He also held leadership roles in various companies, including the executive chairmanship at CLS Holdings, a FTSE 250 commercial property investment company. His business acumen and leadership skills garnered him a reputation as an influential figure in the UK real estate industry. Tice's political career began as a vocal supporter of the Leave campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum. His deep commitment to Brexit led him to co-found Leave Means Leave, a cross-party campaign advocating for a full, clean exit from the European Union. His work in promoting Brexit policies brought him into the political spotlight, ultimately leading to his involvement with The Brexit Party. In 2019, Richard Tice was appointed chairman of The Brexit Party, which was founded by Nigel Farage to pressure the UK government into delivering on the Brexit referendum result. Under his leadership, the party won 29 seats in the 2019 European Parliament elections, becoming the largest single party in the European Parliament at the time. Following the formal departure of the UK from the European Union in January 2020, The Brexit Party rebranded itself as Reform UK. Richard Tice took over as the leader of the party in March 2021 after Nigel Farage stepped down. Under his leadership, Reform UK expanded its focus beyond Brexit, advocating for broader political reforms, including tax cuts, deregulation, and the overhaul of the UK's healthcare and education systems. Tice's vision for Reform UK is to challenge the two-party dominance of British politics, promoting policies aimed at economic growth, smaller government, and greater individual freedom. He has been an outspoken critic of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and has advocated for a more libertarian approach to handling public health crises. As a political leader, Richard Tice is known for his strong media presence, regularly appearing on television, radio, and social media platforms to discuss his party's policies and the future of the UK. He has written for numerous publications and is a frequent commentator on economic and political issues. Richard Tice and Reform UK represent a growing force in British politics, advocating for significant changes in how the country is governed. Tice's leadership, shaped by his business background and commitment to national sovereignty, continues to push for reforms that he believes will make the UK a more prosperous, free, and independent nation. Reform UK aims to attract voters who are disillusioned with the traditional political parties, offering an alternative vision for the country's future. Britain needs successful individuals from business and other sectors to engage in politics to drive meaningful change. By bringing their expertise and leadership skills, these professionals can help improve how the country is run, ensuring that government operations benefit the people rather than serving their own interests. There are numerous areas in the UK that require significant reform, particularly in how the government and civil service function. It's crucial that these institutions work for the people, and not merely serve themselves. The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare many of the shortcomings in the public sector, highlighting the need for strong leadership and decisive action. Stepping into the political arena isn't without its difficulties. Politics can be rough, with its day-to-day challenges and the scrutiny it brings. Beyond the typical hurdles, I've faced other obstacles, including public criticism and legal challenges that emerged after I openly supported Brexit. In 2016, HMRC launched a surprising investigation into my taxes, just as the referendum campaign gained momentum. Despite this scrutiny, the inquiry concluded with me being owed a refund, proving the baseless nature of their investigation. Having done business globally and always fulfilled my tax obligations, the unexpected and aggressive inquiry from HMRC seemed like a targeted response to my political stance. Despite applying to view my HMRC files under the Data Protection Act, I was denied access twice. This lack of transparency raised concerns, but eventually, the investigation confirmed that I had overpaid my taxes. Politics is not always fair. In 2019, I became the subject of false claims from various groups, including a left-wing lobby funded by charities, and even defamatory comments from a Scottish MEP. However, justice prevailed as public apologies were issued and damages were paid to charity. Similarly, BBC Newsnight was forced to retract and apologize for baseless allegations made against me. The 2019 General Election exposed the lengths some media outlets would go to undermine my political candidacy. Channel 4 repeatedly broke election laws in undercover efforts to smear my reputation. Unfortunately, dirty tactics remain a part of traditional politics, even in a democratic country like the UK.",

Voters can choose to extend the failing two-party system that has long taken them for granted or opt for Reform UK, the only party committed to a prosperous, safe, and successful Britain. Joseph Oakley has been an active member of the Broxtowe community for nearly a year, well before announcing his candidacy as MP. Running under Reform UK, Oakley aims to be Broxtowe's dedicated representative in Parliament, bringing fresh, community-focused leadership. This election represents an unparalleled chance for Broxtowe and Britain to challenge the ineffective party placemen entrenched in Westminster. Unlike the traditional main parties, Reform UK offers a real alternative to the unsustainable policies and high taxes of both blue and red parties, which have consistently failed the public. For the first time in decades, Reform UK provides an opportunity to break the cycle of political failure, despite the limitations of the FPTP electoral system. The \"Conservatives\" have lost their credibility, and Labour's lack of a coherent plan further underscores the need for a new approach. Increase the personal allowance to \u00a320,000, saving workers \u00a31,500; abolish business rates for small high street businesses; and reform the benefit system to reintroduce 1 million people into the workforce. Eliminate NHS waiting lists within two years by freezing basic rate tax on NHS and social care staff for three years, lifting the training cap on medical students, and eliminating student debt for those who serve in the NHS for a decade. Opponents may misrepresent Reform UK's migration policy as \"racist,\" but it is based on practical considerations. After 14 years of broken promises from the Tories, Broxtowe lacks the infrastructure to support positive net migration. Reform UK's sensible one-in, one-out policy will help manage immigration effectively. Broxtowe deserves a representative who is bold and capable. Joseph Oakley, the only local candidate with a genuine chance of winning, has invested over \u00a31,000 of his own money supporting local businesses. His experience in teaching, hospitality, and volunteering highlights his deep commitment to the community. On July 4th, Broxtowe has a chance for a fresh start. With your support, Reform UK can make a significant impact. Cast your vote for Joseph Oakley to bring meaningful change to Broxtowe and the country.",

    "biography": "Eddie has no experience of political activism and was just happy to leave it to others, until 2016. He campaigned for Brexit and was betrayed by our politicians. I've watched this country stumble from crisis to crisis, our career politicians only concerned with themselves, lacking common sense, lacking answers, seemingly unaccountable and with a total disconnect with the population. Eddie McDonald was a serving police officer for 30 years with Northamptonshire Police, in every large town and almost every role. Policing provides experiences and a skill set that equiped him to be an effective Member of Parliament. Eddie holds a third Dan black belt in Ju Jitsu and is a qualified personal trainer and he used to help run a martial arts club in Northampton. Eddie has lived in Northamptonshire since 1976 and in the constituency for about ten years, with his wife, who is a schoolteacher. Eddie has four children, all of whom were educated in Corby. Eddie is also frustrated that our Health Service is broken, its mismanaged and for too long has been used as a political football, with the necessary action required to make it a first-class Health Service, put off, for another day. Why can't he and many of you, get an NHS Dentist, or an appointment with a GP when you phone up? Why are our elderly treated as commodities and ignored. Reform and Eddie McDonald will change this. Education is a proven way out of poverty, so why shouldn't we all have the best education, improved facilities and a safe place to learn? Our nation's poorly performing schools need the best teachers to educate, motivate and encourage our children that they can succeed. Eddie will fight for our children's futures and a renewed respect for education. Our Government and Councils continue to mismanage their finances as it's easy to spend someone else's money. Eddie says we elect those who decide how those taxes are spent, its only right that, the Public, hold them to account how they spend our money. Eddie will hold them to account. Increasing Illegal and uncontrolled immigration are having an adverse impact on this country and its infrastructure. An increase of over 10 million people since 2001, resulting in not enough housing, accommodation provided to migrants ahead of vulnerable British people, not able to get a dentist or medical treatment on the NHS, lack of local school places, drain on the Exchequer, increased taxation, and our roads are full of potholes. Reform is the only party that has said it will stop the boats, Reform UK has a plan that involves putting the British People at the centre of everything. Policing and Justice is close to Eddies heart. Do you feel safe in your home or going to the shop? Criminals and the louts, no longer fear being caught, they no longer fear the Police, they no longer fear being punished, they no longer feel community condemnation and they no longer fear Justice. Police Leadership need to get a grip on crimes that impact society, they need to be impartial and our Justice system needs to speed up and get tough on criminals, if we need more jails, build them. Eddie will be tough on criminals and those in the Justice system who fail to share this vision. Justice should be swift and fair, with the victim at the heart of it. Eddie will push for early guilty admissions to be dealt with by the Courts on the day of charge. Trials will be heard even if the defendant fails to turn up to frustrate Justice, this will ensure that Justice is swift, and the victim and witnesses are considered. Eddie also believes we need to invest in our youth, diverting them from a life of crime and to encourage and support our community in challenging this behaviour. It requires a holistic approach with the involvement of local employers, developers, etc. Eddie wants people to be rewarded for their hard work, financial prudence and social responsibility. It's my belief that everyone should contribute to their community to the best of their abilities. The challenges facing us are many and doing the same things, which aren't working again and again, can only be described as stupid and pointless. It's time for change, it's time for Reform.",

He argues that these parties have misled the public and squandered taxpayer money on an unprecedented scale. In his vision for the NHS, Simon proposes free university tuition for nurses and care workers from day one. He emphasizes that while the NHS does not require complete overhaul, reducing waiting times for treatment to zero is essential. He insists that public funds should ensure value for money in all public services. Simon advocates for green energy projects that must be profitable without government subsidies. He also calls for a return to UK government control over immigration, focusing on genuine cases of those in most need. He criticizes the recent failures of the UK Border Force and insists on prioritizing improvements in this area. As a prospective Member of Parliament, Simon Christy is committed to improving the lives of the people of Gedling. If elected, he promises to remain based within the constituency, reflecting his dedication to local issues.",

    "biography": "Mike Rudkin has been a proud resident of Lincolnshire for over 30 years, with deep ancestral ties to the region. Initially moving to the area as a Defence Meteorologist, he has since made Lincolnshire his home, deeply embedding himself in the community. Mike's political journey began during the Brexit campaign, a cause he feels passionately about. Witnessing what he perceives as the mismanagement of the country by the political establishment has inspired him to take action and drive meaningful change. As a staunch advocate for preserving Lincolnshire's rural heritage, Mike is dedicated to maintaining the county's identity as a significant agricultural hub. He is concerned about the local economy's struggles and the increasing pressure on the agricultural industry from financial and regulatory challenges. Mike is committed to defending agricultural land from being repurposed for solar and wind farms and their associated infrastructure. Mike highlights the struggles faced by local NHS services, dentists, and social care providers. He believes that the NHS requires more than temporary fixes and is focused on developing a comprehensive plan to support these essential services. Additionally, he is keenly aware of the need for robust defence, border control, and policing to ensure safety and combat crime. He advocates for a reform of the judicial system to ensure that criminals are held accountable and to address the underfunding and ideological challenges facing the police force. Committed to improving the education system, Mike aims to refocus schools on practical education rather than \"woke\" ideologies. He believes that removing these distractions will reduce stress for both students and teachers. Furthermore, Mike is dedicated to addressing the issues with the county's road system, including poorly maintained and dangerous roads, and ensuring that government funding for repairs is effectively utilized. Mike is concerned about the impact of new housing developments on local infrastructure, including drainage systems and water supply. He believes that investment is crucial to address these issues and improve services such as public transportation. Under Reform UK, Mike supports reducing taxes and cutting car fuel duty to stimulate the economy. He proposes that the first \u00a320,000 of earnings should be tax-free and aims to lower energy bills by reducing subsidies for green energy projects. Mike is eager to represent the people of Grantham and Bourne, promising to make politics fairer, more representative, and accessible. He invites community members to share their thoughts and support his vision for change. No RAF airfields lie within this constituency, but RAF Cranwell is very near to the border to the north/northeast. Many local people are employed directly or indirectly by the defence sector. There is a small Army barracks just to the North of Grantham (Prince William of Gloucester barracks).",

With a deep-rooted connection to Leicestershire, Danuta has spent the last 40 years in Whetstone, adjacent to the Harborough constituency. Her extensive experience teaching and engaging with the local community has given her a profound understanding of the area. At 40, Danuta pursued a teaching degree and has since dedicated herself to educating students across Leicestershire and the East Midlands. Her current role involves teaching ESOL to adult learners from diverse backgrounds, a profession she finds deeply rewarding. Danuta's commitment to education and her passion for supporting people from all walks of life underscore her dedication to meaningful change. In October 2022, Danuta joined Reform UK, driven by her frustration with the current state of British politics. Her disenchantment with the Tory Party, where she had been a member for many years, stemmed from its increasingly undemocratic practices and disregard for the public's will. The party's failure to deliver on Brexit promises and its disregard for manifesto commitments on issues like immigration and public services further fueled her decision to seek change through Reform UK. With over 25 years of experience in both secondary and adult education, Danuta has witnessed the erosion of core British values in the classroom. She is particularly concerned about the sexualization of young minds through controversial teaching on gender recognition. Her observations of left-wing bias and the removal of common sense from educational policies have reinforced her commitment to advocating for traditional values and educational integrity. As a member of WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality), Danuta is passionate about addressing the injustices faced by women born in the 1950s due to flawed pension reforms. Her fight for pension equality reflects her broader commitment to social justice. Additionally, Danuta is determined to combat the stifling of free speech in today's politically charged climate, where expressing traditional views can lead to backlash and even legal consequences. Danuta's decision to join Reform UK is driven by her belief in the party's potential to restore Britain's greatness. She is dedicated to campaigning vigorously across Leicestershire with a dedicated team of Reform UK supporters. Danuta's commitment to advocating for national sovereignty, border control, and cultural identity reflects her resolve to make a tangible difference in British politics. Danuta Jeeves invites you to join her in the mission to \"Make Britain Great Again\" by supporting Reform UK. With her deep passion and unwavering dedication, Danuta aims to bring about the change needed for a stronger, more unified Britain.",

My interests include live entertainment (I am a patron of the Concordia Theatre), discovering new places with my touring caravan, and reading railway and social history. I also support local animal rescue organizations, and I have adopted several older rescue dogs. I love my country and I am not happy with the way it is being governed. I hold the strong belief that we are a sovereign and island nation, and that we should not be governed by any foreign court or organization. I recognize that the inevitable cycle of alternating Team Red and Team Blue at Westminster is a cycle doomed to failure. Both parties have proved unreliable, and both are distracted by interminable and counter-productive internal disagreements. Over the years, neither party has proved willing or capable of offering what we, the electorate, wants and voted for. Owing to this regrettable state of affairs, today it is difficult to find anything in our country which is not broken or which is still fit for purpose. For example - Border Control, the Police, the N.H.S., the Economy, suitable support for Veterans, Cost of Living, Pensions, Employment, Education, etc. The current High Tax and Low Growth policy is unsustainable, and we are seeing our country and our way of life being ruined. We are a democracy, but we are not getting the government that we deserve. Reform UK is the alternative that can help us to achieve a better life. Through Reform UK, I want to help turn our country around. To stop the rot. To bring back prosperity to our country. To mend broken Britain. I am standing as a candidate for Reform UK, because it is the only party that recognizes that we need to examine all our main institutions and work out how they can be restructured and revitalized to meet our needs and how these changes can realistically be financed - as detailed in our equivalent of a manifesto called 'Our Contract with You' on the party website. As your Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Hinckley and Bosworth Constituency, I consider myself very fortunate to have this opportunity to work towards these goals. I believe we can save Britain and make our lives better. A vote for Reform UK is a vote for change - change for the better. An M.P. has an important role in national government, but also has a duty to represent all constituents at a local level. I have lived in Barwell for the past 8 years, so I have genuine local knowledge of the main concerns and problems we face in the constituency where I am standing for election. I know, for example, that there are particular issues concerning the expansion of towns and villages without the infrastructure and facilities being upgraded, thus increasing the pressure on the existing infrastructure and facilities, the present planning system is broken, it ignores cumulative effect of developments and the true need for major road improvements, new schools and G.P. Surgeries, I shall do my best to fight for a common sense, fair and balanced revision of the Planning Laws. I became active in mainstream politics when the Brexit Party was formed. I became a member, and later held the position of Bosworth Constituency Coordinator. When the Brexit Party became Reform UK, I transferred my membership. I have previously served for 10 years as an independent parish councilor, recently I have been a candidate for Reform UK in both the County Council and Borough Council Elections. Now I am hoping that you will support me to act for you on a national level as your Constituency M.P., because, to quote our party, 'Britain needs Reform and Reform needs You'. It can be done, and I really believe we can do it.",

For the past 44 years, he has lived in Charnwood, primarily practicing dentistry in Leicester, as well as in Shepshed and Barrow upon Soar. He is married to Mary and is now retired, but continues to enjoy a range of interests, including cycling, hill walking, languages, music, sailing, DIY projects, travel, and politics. Andy's political journey began in 2011 when he joined UKIP in response to the lack of an EU referendum. He served as the chairman of the UKIP Loughborough & District branch from 2013 to 2018, and ran for UKIP in the 2015 General Election, securing 17% of the vote in North West Leicestershire. In 2016, he was a key figure in Loughborough's BREXIT campaign, working with various political groups. In 2017, Andy stood for UKIP again in Loughborough as a democracy candidate. After joining The Brexit Party in 2018, he campaigned vigorously until December 2019. In 2021, he became the East & West Midlands area manager for Reform UK, and in 2022, he was appointed County Organiser for Leicestershire & Rutland. Now, in 2024, Andy is standing as a Parliamentary candidate for the Loughborough constituency. Andy is deeply concerned about the unsustainable population growth in the UK, which he sees as a fundamental issue driving many national challenges. He advocates for strict immigration controls and a focus on balancing population numbers to ensure a sustainable future. A strong believer in free speech, Andy supports policies grounded in common sense and real-world solutions. He is dedicated to ensuring that political discourse remains open and balanced, valuing reason over political correctness. Andy is critical of globalisation, believing it has contributed to a loss of national sovereignty and weakened the UK's position in the world. He seeks to bring control back to the UK, ensuring that decisions impacting the country are made domestically rather than being influenced by global forces. Andy believes some UK institutions have become overreaching and inefficient. He advocates for significant reforms to bring these bodies back in line with the needs and expectations of the British people. As a candidate for Loughborough, Andy's vision includes achieving a complete BREXIT where UK laws fully govern the country. He supports net-zero immigration with a \"one in, one out\" policy, allowing entry for essential skills that cannot be readily trained domestically. He advocates for an immigration system that ensures those arriving illegally are processed offshore and returned if they reject the legal route. In addition, Andy calls for an energy policy that strengthens UK industry, reducing reliance on foreign economies such as China and India. He is critical of the current \"Net Zero\" policy, labeling it \"Net Stupid\" due to its perceived negative impact on UK economic growth. Andy argues for the integration of cultures based on English values, laws, and language, stating that while every culture matters, the primary focus should be on English identity. He sees multiculturalism as creating division and believes a unified national identity is essential. He also emphasizes that Loughborough's housing challenges are not a result of a housing shortage but rather a population crisis. To address this, Andy seeks long-term solutions to manage population growth and ensure adequate housing supply for future generations.",

Throughout his career, he worked across various boroughs and specialist departments, gaining extensive experience and insight into the communities he served. His time as a family liaison officer, dealing with bereaved families, was especially formative, shaping his belief in the importance of compassion, care, and living fully in the present. In 2018, after a fulfilling career, Sean retired and moved to Lincolnshire to be closer to his family.

Today, Sean is a proud father of four, with his eldest daughter living in Lincoln and expecting his third grandchild, while his younger children are thriving in local schools. Since retiring, Sean has thrown himself into local politics and community activities. He has stood in both district and county elections and has been actively involved in running election campaigns.

Tom's journey into politics began in 1979 when he worked as a pharmacy porter at Leicester Royal Infirmary at the age of sixteen. Witnessing numerous strikes and disputes during this period, he became a union representative at seventeen.

He believes that the UK's shift towards aligning with European models of governance led to the abandonment of its unique and effective system. For him, returning to a central power structure under a Sovereign Parliament is essential to restore the nation's traditional governance. One of Robert's key policy priorities is the abolition of the BBC license fee. He believes that the current funding model is outdated and unfair, and he advocates for a more modern approach to public broadcasting that better reflects the needs and preferences of today's citizens.

    "biography": "As the next general election approaches, the people of North West Leicestershire face a crucial decision: embrace genuine change or settle for more of the same? The need for reform is pressing, and it doesn't mean choosing from the usual pool of career politicians and party insiders. The distinction between Labour and Conservative has diminished significantly, with both parties converging in the political center. Keir Starmer's appeal to conservatives at the Labour party conference was essentially a call to choose them over the Conservatives due to their slightly greater effectiveness. This limited choice fails to inspire meaningful progress. Reform UK offers a genuine alternative for real change. It stands for common sense and a break from oyutdated ideologies and ineffective governance. Reform UK aims to address critical issues such as excessive government spending, high taxation, the Net Zero agenda, uncontrolled immigration, and the influence of the European Court of Human Rights. Unlike the current Westminster consensus, Reform UK is dedicated to achieving the Brexit that the majority of constituents voted for. Noel Matthews has made North West Leicestershire his home and is deeply invested in the community. His young daughter benefits from an excellent state education in Coalville, and his daily work in Ashby-De-La-Zouch keeps him in touch with local challenges. He listens to the concerns of local residents and is committed to addressing them. North West Leicestershire deserves an MP who delivers on local issues rather than focusing narrowly on single issues. Noel Matthews brings valuable experience from various roles, including as a school governor, Town Councillor, NHS nurse, and world-traveling IT Consultant. His diverse background includes work in Nigeria, Thailand, the USA, the Philippines, and the UK, equipping him with a broad perspective on governance and service. The constituency needs a representative who will actively pursue results. While Rishi Sunak has promised to restore the Ivanhoe line, progress has been lacking. There is a need for a representative who will demand tangible progress and protect rural and agricultural areas from over-development. Voters have expressed disappointment with the main parties, and Reform UK offers a viable alternative.",

While the need for change is clear, it doesn't necessitate choosing from the familiar pool of career politicians and party loyalists. The lines between Labour and Conservative have blurred, with both parties converging at the centre, content with their indistinguishable policies. Even Keir Starmer, at the Labour party conference, could only offer the reassurance of being marginally less ineffective than the Conservatives. Such a choice hardly inspires confidence. Reform UK, represented by Golam Kadiri, stands for what it claims: genuine change and practical solutions. The party is committed to rescuing Britain from the grip of extreme wokeism, spiraling public spending, high taxes, the confusion of Net Zero policies, uncontrolled legal and illegal immigration, and the undue influence of the European Court of Human Rights. Most importantly, it seeks to break free from the complacent Westminster consensus that has failed to deliver the true Brexit that the majority in this constituency voted for. Golam Kadiri lives and works in the Midlands, alongside his family. With a long-standing involvement in community work, he is deeply familiar with the challenges faced by the people of Nottingham North and Kimberley. This constituency needs an MP who is attuned to these issues and dedicated to addressing them.

After fourteen years of Conservative governance, he believes that the essence of the places he cherishes is increasingly under threat. Growing up near Billesdon, Clowes enjoyed the area's stunning landscapes and historic towns. The region's charm, from its sporting heroes to its rich medieval and Georgian heritage, is something he deeply values. He fondly recalls traditions like the Medbourne-Hallaton bottlekicking on Easter Monday and local point-to-point races as cherished memories. Clowes has actively volunteered to support the elderly and disabled, learning firsthand the importance of community in the face of sweeping changes. He notes the struggles of the NHS, rising unemployment, and the challenges faced by small businesses as contributing to the erosion of local communities. He observes that many towns and villages are becoming service and pub deserts, further diminishing community spirit. During his tenure in Brussels, Clowes championed rural interests across Europe and realized the scarcity of voices advocating for sensible countryside policies. He had hoped that Brexit would lead to a departure from stringent continental climate targets and metropolitan preferences. However, he has witnessed the encroachment of developments like the Mallard Pass Solar Farm, which he believes are detrimental to local landscapes. As a motorsport engineer, Clowes is critical of Labour councils that impose ULEZ regulations and speed restrictions, which he argues are unscientific and detrimental to working people. He views these restrictions as a tax on freedom and is determined to prevent their expansion into Stamford and Rutland. Clowes recognizes that small businesses are the backbone of Rutland and is committed to advocating for legislation that would alleviate tax burdens on these businesses. He believes that small shops on the high street are unfairly penalized compared to larger enterprises, which contributes to their closures. By addressing excessive running costs and high energy bills, Clowes aims to support local retailers and ensure a vibrant high street. Clowes emphasizes the need to protect the rich history of the constituency, including landmarks such as the Normanton Church on Rutland Water and the site of Isaac Newton's apple tree. He expresses frustration with Tory policies that he believes undermine rural interests while prioritizing metropolitan concerns. He criticizes the government's handling of the Mallard Pass Solar Farm and calls for greater support for farmers, arguing against the trend towards large-scale, impersonal farming operations. Through his efforts, Chris Clowes seeks to ensure that the values and heritage of Rutland and Stamford are preserved for future generations, despite the challenges posed by current policies and developments.",

She is committed to promoting Reform UK's policies throughout the Sherwood Forest constituency, which will see a newly defined boundary and an electorate of 76,676 in the 2024 general election. The Sherwood Forest Constituency has experienced significant growth in housing, yet there has been no corresponding improvement in essential services. The lack of new GP surgeries, dentists, school places, and police presence has led to declining living standards. The deteriorating state of the roads symbolizes the broader infrastructure challenges faced by residents. Helen believes that the residents of Sherwood Forest deserve better value for their taxes and improved local services. She attributes many local issues to national policies, including mass immigration and the costly pursuit of net-zero targets. Frustrated by the lackluster representation and broken promises from the Uniparty system, Helen is standing for Reform UK to address these concerns. With over 63% of Sherwood Forest voters supporting Brexit in the referendum and feeling let down by the current political establishment, Helen invites those who share her dissatisfaction to join her campaign.

Ben will give local people a real choice at the ballot box. Ben said: \"I am thrilled to have the chance to represent Wellingborough in parliament. My message is clear. Labour and the Tories are two sides of the same coin. A vote for either means more uncontrolled mass immigration. Higher taxes. Longer GP waiting lists. And the cost of living crisis will get worse.\" \"Crime and anti-social behaviour are real problems here. We will get dozens more police on the beat and smash the 'county lines' drug gangs. Violent criminals will be locked up for life. No more politically correct nonsense.\" \"I can't wait to bring our message to local people. Only Reform UK will stand up for British values. Only Reform UK has the leadership and common sense policies to save Britain.\" Ben Habib, a notable businessman and politician, is standing as the Reform UK candidate for the Wellingborough & Rushden constituency in the upcoming general election. Reform UK, originally founded as the Brexit Party, has its roots in advocating for the United Kingdom's full exit from the European Union. However, the party has since evolved, now focusing on broader issues such as immigration, economic reform, and governmental transparency. As a key figure within Reform UK, Ben Habib represents the party's commitment to these principles, and his candidacy for Wellingborough & Rushden is emblematic of his dedication to addressing the challenges that local communities face. Ben Habib has a long history in business, most notably in the property sector. He was the CEO of First Property Group, a successful real estate investment company. His business acumen has often been highlighted as one of his strengths, bringing a focus on economic reform, fiscal responsibility, and a practical approach to governance. Habib's entrepreneurial background provides him with insights into economic development and job creation, which are important issues for the Wellingborough & Rushden constituency. Politically, Habib gained prominence as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Brexit Party, representing London in 2019. His tenure in the European Parliament saw him strongly advocating for a clean break from the EU, expressing concerns about the perceived compromises in Brexit negotiations. His approach emphasized national sovereignty and the need for the UK to regain control of its laws, borders, and economy. These themes continue to resonate in his candidacy for Wellingborough & Rushden, though his platform has broadened to address domestic concerns. One of Ben Habib's key priorities in the Wellingborough & Rushden constituency is to tackle the local economic challenges. Wellingborough and Rushden, like many parts of the UK, have felt the effects of economic uncertainty, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and rising inflation. Habib's business background equips him to advocate for policies that stimulate local businesses, attract investment, and create jobs. He has consistently highlighted the need for lower taxes and reduced regulation to encourage entrepreneurship and economic growth. Immigration is another core issue that Habib and Reform UK emphasize. Habib advocates for tighter control of the UK's borders, a position rooted in the party's broader platform of ensuring national security and reducing pressure on public services. In Wellingborough & Rushden, where public services such as healthcare and education are key concerns for voters, Habib argues that reducing immigration would alleviate strain on these services, ensuring that local resources are allocated effectively. In addition to these economic and immigration policies, Habib is a vocal critic of the current political establishment. He has expressed frustration with what he sees as a lack of transparency and accountability in government, arguing that both the Conservative and Labour parties have failed to deliver for the British people. Reform UK positions itself as an alternative to the traditional two-party system, promising to bring a fresh perspective to governance, free from the influence of career politicians. Ben Habib's candidacy for Wellingborough & Rushden represents Reform UK's broader ambition to reshape British politics. With his background in business and his commitment to Reform UK's core principles-economic reform, immigration control, and government accountability-Habib offers voters in Wellingborough & Rushden an alternative to the status quo. As the general election approaches, his message of practical solutions and political reform is likely to resonate with voters seeking change in their representation.",

Edward is deeply committed to ensuring that every voice is heard, a right that has significantly diminished over the past two decades under successive Conservative and Labour governments. With a background as a single parent, small business owner, and taxpayer, Edward Apostolides brings a wealth of real-world experience that resonates with many in the community. His personal journey enables him to more effectively articulate the interests and concerns of the constituents he aims to represent. The decline witnessed in recent years is profoundly troubling. Edward highlights several pressing issues: unsustainable mass immigration, the economic strain caused by soaring taxes, and the exorbitant rise in the cost of essentials like food, housing, and energy bills. Public services have also suffered, with millions languishing on NHS waiting lists-some for years-and the difficulty of securing face-to-face appointments with GPs. Moreover, the absurd rise of wokeism has impacted institutions such as the police, schools, and universities. Edward also voices concern over the government's blind pursuit of an unachievable net zero target, which he believes will only impoverish the most vulnerable in society and reduce the nation's productivity and prosperity. The challenges faced by the country are severe and urgent. Edward asserts that politicians from the two main parties have long been arrogant, inept, and out of touch. Their blatant dishonesty and dismissal of the British public's wishes have led to a widespread loss of trust. Edward believes that the public has been misled for far too long, and it is time to demand a change. Reform UK is the only party offering common-sense policies based on the needs of the people, rather than pursuing virtue-signaling ideologies that hold no real meaning for the majority of British citizens. Edward Apostolides stands ready to bring about meaningful change and restore trust in political representation.",

His early experiences laid the groundwork for a distinguished career in the energy sector. Peter Sceats is renowned for founding the commodity price indices that underpin the international coal market. His expertise led him to become the Head of Risk Management for the world's largest energy company, a role he held until May 2020. Today, he leverages his deep industry knowledge as an expert witness in energy litigation while also overseeing his family's burgeoning gin brand. The Bethnal Green Tube Disaster, which claimed the life of his cousin Lillian, motivated Peter to collaborate with the Stairway to Heaven Charity. His efforts contributed significantly to the fundraising for the memorial in Bethnal Green Gardens, reflecting his commitment to honoring the past and supporting his community. Initially a supporter of the Referendum Party, Peter actively campaigned for Vote Leave during the 2016 EU referendum. His political advocacy continued with the March 2021 launch of the \"Fairness in Publicly Funded Salaries\" petition, proposing a salary cap for all publicly funded roles in the UK, pegged to the Prime Minister's salary. Peter Sceats believes that the traditional Left vs. Right political dichotomy is outdated. Instead, he champions a perspective that contrasts common sense with a \"woke,\" climate-obsessed, and tax-hiking elite. As a member of Reform UK, he is committed to representing common sense values, combining hard work, efficiency, and compassion in his service to constituents.

His ties to Dulwich and West Norwood (DAWN) run deep, having lived in various parts of the constituency since the early 1990s. His first job in the UK was at the Crown & Greyhound in Dulwich Village, and he has been actively involved with a local rugby club for nine years, where he serves as an IRB-qualified rugby coach. Gary has enjoyed a long-standing career in IT and finance, beginning with his work in investment banking in London in the early 1990s. He is currently a director at a major investment bank, managing high-profile projects as a program manager. This role has allowed him to blend his passion for IT and finance, making it a dream come true to work in one of the world's financial hubs. Gary became politically active in 2017 after years of following the political landscape. In 2018, he was elected as a local Councillor in Bromley. During his time in office, he tackled key issues such as housing, traffic, and community development. One of his most notable accomplishments was leading the charge to implement secure online council meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring that the democratic process continued uninterrupted. As a local Councillor, Gary developed a deep understanding of the challenges faced by the people of Dulwich and West Norwood (DAWN). If elected as an MP, he pledges to focus on addressing the local issues that matter most. His experience in sports club management will also help him support community organisations that rely on volunteers, which he views as an essential part of the local fabric. Gary is a staunch opponent of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) and the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), which he believes disproportionately impact lower-income communities and disrupt social cohesion.

However, Reform UK is committed to fielding a full slate of candidates and ensuring the British people have a clear and democratic choice. On July 4th, Gary urges the people of DAWN and the UK to seize their own Independence Day by rejecting the dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties.

Leon highlights that a vote for him in Ealing North on July 4th is a vote for true reform, aiming to challenge the status quo and bring about real, people-focused leadership. For too long, the political landscape has been dominated by two parties that Leon believes no longer serve the interests of the British people. He contends that the Conservatives and Labour both prioritize global elites, such as unelected members of the World Economic Forum, over the needs of the nation. Leon advocates for a fresh approach, where politicians are accountable solely to the people of the United Kingdom. By voting for Leon Harris, residents of Ealing North can help bring about this much-needed change. Leon Harris is deeply concerned about the rapid changes in London, citing uncontrolled migration as a key issue. He points out that under the Conservative government, native Britons are at risk of becoming a minority, and the city has drastically altered in just four years. Leon warns that Labour, led by Keir Starmer, will continue this trajectory if left unchecked. He also emphasizes the housing crisis, where ever-rising prices and rents are putting home ownership out of reach for many young people. Leon Harris is passionate about addressing the mounting pressure on the NHS. He recognizes the difficulty families face in accessing emergency medical care and believes that immediate action is needed to alleviate these burdens. Additionally, Leon is committed to protecting children from what he views as harmful ideologies being introduced in schools, such as the promotion of gender identity discussions at a young age. He pledges to put an end to what he describes as \"woke nonsense\" in education. Leon Harris criticizes local councils for what he sees as wasteful spending on symbolic projects like colorful road crossings while neglecting essential services like drainage, leading to flooding issues. He believes that these councils are using climate change as an excuse to impose unfair ULEZ charges on residents. Leon promises to redirect taxpayer money toward practical solutions that benefit the community, rather than politically motivated initiatives. A key policy of Leon Harris's campaign is to tackle the cost-of-living crisis created by years of Conservative mismanagement. He proposes raising the income tax threshold from \u00a312,540 to \u00a320,000, which would result in an additional \u00a33,000 a year for working citizens.

Despite being ignored by the Conservative government, his action garnered significant national media attention and marked the beginning of his public activism. His efforts to engage with the government through written appeals were met with silence, reinforcing his resolve to challenge the political establishment. The introduction of the ULEZ policy by the Labour Mayor of London, despite widespread opposition and legal challenges, highlighted the need for systemic change and further motivated Prabhdeep. In August 2023, Prabhdeep intensified his activism with a week-long hunger strike at Uxbridge station against the ULEZ expansion. This high-profile protest drew international media coverage and public support, culminating in a mass hunger strike outside the Mayor's residence. Recognizing the limitations of street-level protests, Prabhdeep decided to escalate his efforts to the parliamentary stage. Aligning with the Reform UK party, Prabhdeep is now poised to bring his fight for justice and democratic integrity to the heart of British politics as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Feltham and Heston. His journey from Punjab to the forefront of UK political reform exemplifies his unwavering commitment to advocating for the working class and transforming the political landscape through integrity and persistence.",

With a deep understanding of the challenges faced by local communities, Catherine is committed to enacting practical solutions rather than engaging in partisan politics. Catherine has witnessed the decline of Hampstead under decades of Labour leadership. She believes that real solutions are possible if local governance is approached with the same business-like efficiency applied to financial management and investments. Key areas of focus include: : Hampstead is currently the third most crime-ridden area in London. Catherine advocates for increased funding for frontline police and comprehensive strategies to address the root causes of crime, aiming to enhance public safety and restore confidence in our streets. : Both Labour and Conservative parties have fallen short in committing to improvements in schools, GP clinics, local transport, and road infrastructure. Catherine's approach includes supporting both drivers and cyclists, enhancing the safety and functionality of streets to better serve all residents, including the elderly and those requiring delivery services. : While supporting affordable housing, Catherine emphasizes the need for parallel investments in local amenities. The O2 Centre, approved by Labour, exemplifies the pitfalls of insufficient planning for increased demand on infrastructure and services. Catherine advocates for reducing both national and local taxation to make work more attractive and to ensure responsible spending. She supports tendering out contracts to ensure the best value, promoting fairer, lower taxes for businesses and local shops, and improving employment laws post-Brexit.

He observes a troubling trend of deterioration across multiple sectors, pointing to the perceived incompetence of politicians as a significant factor. Clark highlights issues such as rising knife crime, a strained criminal justice system, and widespread dysfunction as evidence of this decline. He also notes the pressure on public services due to a rapidly increasing population, as well as threats to food security, borders, and the Green Belt. Additionally, he criticizes the diminishing quality of the civil service. Clark's overarching concern is that politicians and state institutions no longer serve the public effectively. He believes that many of these entities are no longer fit for purpose and are, in fact, contributing to the nation's decline. According to Clark, this betrayal by the institutions is evident in their failure to address pressing issues and meet the needs of the people. Roger Clark advocates for comprehensive reforms at every level of government and state institutions. He identifies the need for changes across the Head of State and the Royal Family, the House of Lords, the House of Commons, various government departments, agencies, devolved governments, local governments, and decision-making processes.

With both his mother hailing from West Harrow and his father from South Harrow, his connection to the community is profound. His parents' marriage on Harrow Hill marks a long-standing family legacy in the region. Beavis is disillusioned with the current political landscape, which he believes is plagued by insincerity and relentless electioneering. He criticizes previous governments for making financial promises that the economy can no longer sustain. Addressing these issues is seen as politically risky, but Beavis argues it is necessary. With high taxes, escalating debt, an ageing population, and a declining birth rate, he contends that the balance of taxation and benefits needs urgent reform. Beavis advocates for a focus on economic growth and increasing median take-home pay. He criticizes the current taxation and benefits systems as overly complex and obstructive to personal advancement. He suggests integrating National Insurance into Income Tax to simplify the system and address its ineffectiveness for the wealthy. Beavis also proposes that Child Benefit be reformed to favor tax allowances for married parents with children. Beavis supports stricter tax policies for companies operating under tax havens, suggesting higher sales taxes for those that do not contribute fairly to the UK economy. He also calls for a reduction in the allowable days for tax avoidance through overseas residency from 90 days to just 5. Additionally, he believes that immigrants committing serious crimes should be deported regardless of their family status and that asylum applications should be processed online before entry. Beavis critiques the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) for its mission creep and delays, proposing that the UK leave the ECHR while retaining beneficial laws and monitoring future decisions. He advocates for stricter immigration controls and adjustments to personal independence payments, suggesting they should be reserved for those with visible, untreatable disabilities. Beavis believes that critical issues such as economic reform are overshadowed by less significant controversies in the media. He argues that while issues like Partygate and antisemitism in the Labour Party are important, they are not as crucial as addressing the economic challenges facing the nation. According to Beavis, only Reform UK is equipped to tackle these pressing issues effectively. He calls for voters to support the party for meaningful change and a better future for the country.",

A vote for Joshua means a pledge to prevent the construction of more of these imposing structures, ensuring the local area remains inviting and homely. Joshua Leon Pearl is dedicated to initiating comprehensive reforms across national government services. The current state of these services, degraded by successive governments, demands urgent attention. Key areas in need of reform include: The centralization of the Probate Registry since 2020 has led to significant delays, causing distress for bereaved families. Previously, obtaining a Grant of Probate took 3-4 weeks; now it can take 4-6 months. Joshua advocates for streamlining this process to reduce waiting times. The processing time for lease applications and other registrations has extended to about two years, a stark increase from the past. Joshua aims to address this inefficiency and restore prompt service by addressing staffing issues. Joshua warns that VAT on private school fees could force many private and faith-based schools to close, exacerbating the strain on already overcrowded state schools. He advocates for policies to protect educational access. Despite increased funding, 12% of the British population remains on NHS waiting lists. Joshua supports reforms to improve NHS efficiency and address issues like tax penalties for senior doctors, which have led to a shortage in the medical field. Joshua calls for a review of the tax system, which currently discourages movement and investment in the property sector due to high stamp duty and reduced capital gains tax allowances. He aims to address these disincentives to promote property market activity. Joshua critiques the failures of privatisation, particularly in the water sector, where lack of accountability has led to environmental harm.

His extensive experience has equipped him with valuable insights into the needs and pitfalls of building and expanding businesses. Mark Fox is a staunch advocate for helping individuals achieve their full potential in both their professional and personal lives. He believes that unlocking individual potential is crucial for fostering a vibrant, prosperous, and caring society. This fundamental truth is often overlooked in debates about national prosperity and growth. To drive economic growth, a government's primary focus should be on enhancing the prosperity of its people. Prosperity leads to investment, both domestic and international. In contrast, policies that impose heavy taxation, create vague programs, or pursue unrealistic social engineering often hinder progress. Mark emphasizes that behind every policy or scheme, there is a planner with specific agendas. Since the 2008 banking crisis, the UK's economic growth has slowed significantly. While the economy has technically grown, this is largely due to an increasing population, which has skewed growth figures downward. Consequently, the average person is financially worse off than in 2008. In a low-growth economy with a rising population, increasing taxes is not a viable solution. Instead, a government should focus on putting money back into people's pockets. Reform UK is committed to this approach, unlike other parties.

They can choose between supporting traditional parties-Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, or Greens-that align with global agendas such as the United Nations and World Economic Forum's Agenda 2030, 'Build Back Better,' and the 'Great Reset.' Alternatively, they can opt for a party committed to addressing the concerns and demands of the electorate. Ruth Handyside's decision to vote for Brexit was driven by a desire to reclaim British sovereignty. ReformUK, the party she supports, advocates for rejecting the influence of the World Economic Forum and withdrawing from the World Health Organisation. They oppose the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which poses risks such as restricting access to bank accounts or imposing spending deadlines. ReformUK is also critical of the imposition of 15-minute cities that could limit personal freedom. This election presents a chance to defend and restore individual freedoms. As a teacher, Ruth Handyside is concerned about the impact of smartphones in schools. The prevalence of phone addiction among students is affecting their attention spans and learning capabilities. Additionally, smartphones can facilitate bullying and the dissemination of controversial ideologies like transgender issues and Critical Race Theory. ReformUK plans to address these concerns by launching inquiries into these educational challenges. Ruth Handyside is troubled by the rising levels of knife crime and general crime in London. ReformUK aims to bolster police presence and refocus efforts on combating crime rather than regulating social media comments or promoting ideological agendas. Their approach prioritizes effective law enforcement to enhance public safety. ReformUK proposes the establishment of an Excess Deaths and Vaccine Harms Public Inquiry. During the Covid pandemic, misinformation and pressure regarding vaccines were rampant, with dissenting voices from credible doctors being censored. This inquiry seeks to uncover the truth and prevent such occurrences in the future, ensuring transparency and accountability in public health policies.

He previously served as a civil servant for cabinet ministers and worked in Parliament, later representing the energy industry in media and government. Tony was a key advocate for maintaining the role of gas in our energy mix, and he remains a vocal critic of the Tory Net Zero policy, opposing the removal of gas boilers. Tony Glover is a candidate for the Greater London Assembly representing the London North East constituency, which includes the London Boroughs of Hackney, Islington, and Waltham Forest. He aims to address the challenges facing the area by eliminating unnecessary traffic restrictions and ensuring that the police focus on street-level crime rather than social media. Tony is deeply concerned about the current Poplar and Limehouse Labour MP's association with extremist groups like Hamas, which he believes has contributed to division within the community. He criticizes both the Tory Government and the previous Labour local council, along with Sadiq Khan, for their role in encouraging overdevelopment that has strained local infrastructure and impacted essential services such as water pressure. Tony Glover highlights the failures of the current Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman, who, despite his rhetoric, has been ineffective in fostering community unity and addressing local issues. Tony points out that the current Labour MP has aligned with Rahman, contributing to divisive politics and failing to effectively represent constituents. He believes that significant reform is needed in Poplar and Limehouse to better serve local residents and improve local jobs, housing, and transport.",

Reform UK is committed to prioritizing the needs of the nation, and Alexander Starling stands ready to bring this commitment to Parliament. Alexander Starling is dedicated to addressing both local and national concerns. He is particularly critical of the energy policies supported by the main parties, which he believes will lead to significant hardship for UK citizens without achieving meaningful benefits. For instance, the decision by the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg in 2010 to reject clean and green nuclear power, citing delays in implementation, has had long-lasting impacts. Alexander argues that the investment in such infrastructure, made at historically low interest rates, could have significantly altered the current energy landscape. Alexander Starling encourages voters to explore Reform UK's Contract, which details the party's plan to create a better, safer, and fairer UK for all. Reform UK is focused on securing a prosperous future for the next generation, striving to enhance the quality of life for future citizens. He believes that continuing with the established parties-Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats, and Green-only perpetuates outdated politics and failed policies.",

Under Labour's long-standing control, Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council has faced scrutiny over its decisions and ambitious projects, including a town centre shopping arcade whose budget skyrocketed from \u00a345 million to over \u00a3220 million, and a contentious footbridge project that ballooned from \u00a33 million to over \u00a313 million.

    "biography": "For the first time in years, voters face a genuine choice in the general election. The established parties, stuck in their old ways and following similar agendas, offer more of the same. Alternatively, there is an opportunity for real change with new faces and a business-like approach to governance that prioritizes the people over state interests and global corporations. John Swales is committed to halting the erosion of the UK's cultures and values caused by global entities and a complacent government that seeks to transform the UK into a servile state. John Swales believes in the strength, resilience, and pride of the UK. He advocates for a departure from uncontrolled government spending, the highest taxation and borrowing levels in 70 years, and destructive policies such as net zero, DEI, the ECHR, and unlimited immigration. The Labour and Conservative parties, having created these issues, cannot be expected to resolve them. Swales calls for fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and a return of control to the people. Born and raised in Harrogate, John Swales is a proud Yorkshireman with deep roots in the community. His family has a legacy of running local businesses, including the Yorkshire Farmers Butchers Company, giving him a profound understanding of the area, its people, and its heritage. Swales is acutely aware of local challenges, such as overburdened NHS services, inadequate affordable housing, and deteriorating infrastructure. He highlights the inefficacy of the \"Harrogate Gateway\" scheme, which has squandered nearly \u00a32 million in consultancy fees and remains unpopular with residents. Swales emphasizes the need for a Member of Parliament who genuinely represents Harrogate and Knaresborough-a candidate with real-life and business experience rather than a career politician. He advocates for empowering local businesses rather than imposing additional legislation and taxation. The vibrant local business community is essential for job creation and optimism in the area. With over 20 years of experience running businesses both in the UK and internationally, John Swales has a thorough understanding of the challenges faced by businesses and appreciates their contributions. His voluntary work with local charities has instilled in him a commitment to supporting these organizations. However, he also calls for reform in the charity sector to prevent the misuse of charitable status for political purposes. John Swales acknowledges the widespread disillusionment with major parties and offers an alternative. He invites voters to support him and join his team of dedicated activists to make a real difference. For those seeking a representative who is determined and results-driven, Swales urges them to vote for Reform UK on polling day.",

My journey from political apathy to active engagement began out of concern for the future of our nation. As a mother, wife, and citizen, I am alarmed by the current state of our democracy and the erosion of our freedoms. This dissatisfaction drives my candidacy for Spen Valley. My decision to run for office stems from a profound sense of duty to safeguard the future for my son and our community.

Matt is passionate about introducing innovative ideas and fostering real change in response to years of political mismanagement and dishonesty from both Labour and the Tories. His mission is to voice the concerns of the silent majority who have been neglected by successive governments. Matt Lansley proudly supports Reform UK's dynamic manifesto, designed to deliver immediate benefits to the working population. The current cost of living crisis, exacerbated by poor political decisions, is eroding household finances. Reform UK's plan includes making the first \u00a320,000 of income tax-free, eliminating VAT on energy bills, and reducing fuel duty. These measures aim to provide direct relief to individuals and businesses across the UK. Bedford is set to be significantly impacted by Labour's proposed tax on independent education, a policy that will affect every child in the area, including those in state education. Matt Lansley is committed to opposing this detrimental policy and standing up for Bedford's educational needs. Despite its beauty, Bedford faces a growing number of empty shops and business closures. To counteract this trend, Reform UK proposes removing business rates for small high street retailers and reducing Corporation Tax to 20%. These steps are intended to rejuvenate the town center and stimulate economic growth. The current high tax rates are coupled with deteriorating public services. The strain from record levels of immigration is impacting housing, the NHS, and schools. Matt Lansley advocates for a sensible immigration strategy that ensures adequate resources for essential services and halts non-essential immigration to manage current demands effectively. Matt Lansley is committed to ending illegal immigration by ensuring zero illegal entries into the UK and swiftly processing applications. Collaborating with French authorities, the goal is to dismantle criminal networks profiting from illegal immigration. Additionally, he aims to enhance public safety by recruiting 40,000 new frontline officers and reinstating stop-and-search practices in high-risk areas to address drug dealing and knife crime. The NHS, despite high levels of spending, is struggling with long wait times and service quality. Matt Lansley believes that the issues stem from bloated management and inefficiencies. By modeling reforms on successful European healthcare systems, Reform UK aims to deliver a more effective and efficient NHS. To counter the influence of an out-of-touch elite, Reform UK plans to introduce Proportional Representation, reduce the size of the House of Lords, and reform the Civil Service. These changes are designed to foster a more responsive and accountable political system. Matt Lansley calls for a shift towards common-sense governance to reverse the decline of the two-party system.

His deep roots in the community have shaped his perspective on local and national issues. Paul has been a consistent voter throughout his life, but recent years have left him increasingly disillusioned. He is frustrated with the incompetence, dishonesty, and unfulfilled promises of the prevailing government. Additionally, the opposition party seems to offer more of the same, leaving Paul to believe that Britain deserves a better option. He finds Reform UK to be a genuine alternative to the current two-party system. Paul is concerned about the unsustainable levels of immigration experienced in recent years and the impact of the race towards net zero, which he believes disproportionately affects the poorest members of society. He advocates for a low-regulation, low-taxation economy that promotes free-market principles. Paul is also committed to ensuring that the rights of victims are prioritized over the rights of criminals and that children are protected while the elderly are respected. Paul points out the government's misplaced priorities, citing the \u00a337 billion spent on a failed test track and trace system during the Covid pandemic. In contrast, essential services like the NHS, social care, education, and the criminal justice system remain underfunded. With taxation at its highest level in over 70 years and government overreach at an all-time high, Paul argues that Westminster has lost sight of its primary role: serving the people rather than dictating to them. Upon discovering Reform UK, Paul found a party that resonated with his views. Although standing as a political candidate was not originally on his agenda, circumstances have led him to this path. Paul has been selected to represent Reform UK in the upcoming General Election, providing the people of Brentwood and Ongar with a viable alternative to the entrenched two-party system.

Eric Masters has spent most of his life in the beautiful county of Norfolk, despite his career taking him across various locations. Norfolk is where he raised his family, valuing the benefits of rural life over the conveniences of city living and motorway access. Although work commitments sometimes kept him away, the lifestyle and community in Norfolk have always been a significant part of his life. Eric's professional journey has led him to many challenging places, yet his faith has been a steadfast source of strength. Now enjoying a more stable life, he cherishes time spent with his wife, who has dedicated 36 years to working in a children's nursery. Her work has been incredibly fulfilling, witnessing generations of children grow and thrive within the same industry. Eric's decision to stand for election stems from deep concern for his grandchildren's future. Over the past 50 years, successive governments have focused on short-term goals, leaving pressing issues-such as the budget deficit, energy policy, housing, NHS, defense, and immigration-unresolved. This neglect has also seeped into local government services like planning, road safety, and flood management. The current short-sighted approach in Westminster is driving Eric to stand for election. He fears that decisions made today could negatively impact future generations, potentially degrading the nation into a state of decline. He envisions a future with a burgeoning population, high unemployment among graduates, and increasing poverty due to a strained benefits culture. Eric believes that to preserve Great Britain's values and avoid becoming a diminished version of its former self, a change in direction is essential. He urges voters to look beyond traditional tax-and-spend parties and the often reckless actions of established parties, making their choices based on informed judgment rather than media influence.",

    "biography": "Nigel Farage was born on April 3, 1964, and began his career in finance before venturing into politics. His early professional experience laid the groundwork for his later political engagements, particularly his focus on issues related to national sovereignty and regulatory reform. Farage gained prominence as the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), where he became a vocal advocate for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. His charismatic leadership and passionate rhetoric were instrumental in mobilizing public support for Brexit. Under his leadership, UKIP became a significant force in British politics, influencing the national debate on EU membership. From 1999 to 2020, Farage served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England. During his time in the European Parliament, he was known for his critical stance on EU policies and his calls for increased British sovereignty. His tenure was marked by frequent confrontations with EU officials and a relentless campaign for the UK's departure from the EU. In 2019, Farage founded the Brexit Party, which quickly emerged as a major political player advocating for a clean break from the European Union. The party's success was evident in the 2019 European Parliament elections, where it secured the most votes of any UK party. Farage's strategic leadership and media presence played a crucial role in the party's achievements and in shaping the Brexit narrative. As of 2024, Nigel Farage remains a significant figure in British politics, using his media platforms and public speaking opportunities to influence political discourse. His career reflects a consistent commitment to advocating for British independence and redefining the UK's relationship with the EU. Nigel Farage, the well-known British politician and former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), is standing as the Reform UK candidate for the Clacton constituency. Farage is a central figure in British politics, having been a key architect of the Brexit movement, and his decision to contest the Clacton seat as a Reform UK candidate signals a significant moment in both his career and the broader political landscape of the UK. Reform UK, previously known as the Brexit Party, continues to push for fundamental changes in the way the UK is governed, focusing on issues such as immigration control, economic reform, and greater governmental transparency. Nigel Farage has had a long and impactful career in British politics. He is best known for his leadership of UKIP, a party that gained significant traction in the early 2000s as it campaigned for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Farage's charisma and persistence played a major role in shifting the debate over Britain's EU membership from the fringes to the mainstream. In 2016, he was instrumental in the successful Leave campaign, which resulted in the UK voting to exit the EU. Although he never won a seat in the House of Commons, Farage's influence was undeniable. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for over two decades and used his platform to advocate for national sovereignty and British independence from Brussels. After the Brexit referendum, Farage stepped down from the leadership of UKIP, though he continued to be an influential figure in British politics. He later founded the Brexit Party, which morphed into Reform UK after the UK officially left the EU, aiming to push for reforms in the political system that Farage and his supporters felt were still necessary. Clacton, located on the Essex coast, is a constituency with a unique political history. It was represented by Douglas Carswell, a former Conservative MP who famously defected to UKIP in 2014, becoming the first MP elected to Parliament under the UKIP banner. This made Clacton a symbol of the growing support for euroscepticism and a desire for political change, particularly in working-class coastal areas that felt left behind by mainstream parties. Given Clacton's history and its strong support for Brexit, Farage's candidacy is seen as a natural fit. The constituency voted overwhelmingly to leave the European Union in 2016, and many voters remain dissatisfied with how the government has handled the post-Brexit landscape. Farage, with his deep association with Brexit and his consistent stance on reducing immigration and reclaiming national sovereignty, speaks to these frustrations. As a Reform UK candidate, Farage's platform in Clacton will focus on several core issues. Immigration control remains one of his central themes, as Farage has long argued that unchecked immigration is damaging the fabric of British society and placing immense pressure on public services like the NHS and schools. He advocates for a points-based immigration system to ensure that only individuals with skills beneficial to the UK economy can settle in the country. In Clacton, where there are concerns about job competition and access to services, this message is likely to resonate. Economic reform is another major aspect of Farage's campaign. Clacton, like many parts of coastal Britain, has faced economic challenges, including unemployment and underinvestment. Farage argues that lowering taxes, reducing bureaucracy, and incentivizing business investment are necessary steps to revive local economies. He also supports the idea of free ports, which could offer tax breaks and boost trade in areas like Clacton, driving economic growth and job creation. Farage is also campaigning for a political system overhaul. Reform UK believes that the current system is broken, with both major parties-Labour and the Conservatives-failing to represent ordinary citizens. Farage advocates for proportional representation, which he argues would lead to a more democratic and accountable political system. Nigel Farage's candidacy for the Clacton constituency as a Reform UK candidate is a significant moment for both him and the party. His long-standing leadership in the Brexit movement, combined with his new focus on political and economic reform, makes him a strong contender in a constituency that has historically supported eurosceptic views. With a platform focused on immigration control, economic regeneration, and political reform, Farage's campaign offers Clacton voters a familiar but revitalized choice for representation in Parliament. His candidacy signals not just a return to the political frontline for Farage, but also a renewed push for Reform UK's vision of a transformed Britain.",

Reform UK, under Palmer's leadership, will work to \"stop the boats\" and put an end to the unchecked immigration that is overwhelming public services and altering British society. As a passionate advocate for the NHS, Palmer acknowledges the need for reform to ensure its long-term sustainability. While funding remains in line with other Western nations, Palmer argues that the real problem lies in waste, mismanagement, bureaucracy, and poor procurement. His call for a full review of the NHS aims to streamline operations, cut inefficiencies, and secure its future as a vital public service. \"Change won't happen until you vote for change,\" Palmer emphasizes. He invites the community to join the movement, volunteer, and help campaign for a better Britain. For those eager to make a difference, Palmer is ready to lead the charge for Reform UK and put the nation on a path to progress.",

    "biography": "Rupert Lowe, Reform UK's dedicated candidate, steps forward with a clear vision for a revitalized Britain. Faced with mounting challenges, Rupert brings a fresh perspective, promising policies to tackle the pressing issues gripping our nation. Under the Conservative Party's leadership, Britain faces unprecedented challenges. Rupert Lowe recognizes the urgency of the situation. Skyrocketing national debt, burdensome taxes, and strained public services have left citizens disillusioned. The NHS struggles under the weight of lengthy waiting lists, while crime rates soar unchecked. Rupert Lowe pledges to confront these issues head-on, offering tangible solutions for a brighter future. Rupert Lowe understands the hardships faced by hardworking Britons. He vows to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis by prioritizing the needs of the working and middle classes. Through targeted tax cuts, particularly for the self-employed and small businesses, Rupert aims to stimulate economic growth and empower individuals to thrive. By curbing mass immigration and slashing cheap imported labor, Rupert promises to safeguard British jobs and bolster the economy. Life must be affordable for all citizens. Rupert Lowe advocates for practical measures to ease financial burdens, including reevaluation of Net Zero policies and reductions in business rates. Safety is paramount, and Rupert emphasizes the importance of robust law enforcement to combat crime effectively. He stands firm against illegal immigration and advocates for greater governmental accountability to the people. Rupert Lowe's message resonates with those seeking genuine reform. With a commitment to common-sense policies, Reform UK offers a unique platform focused on enriching communities and enhancing citizen well-being. By casting your vote for Rupert Lowe, you support a seismic shift in our political landscape, challenging the status quo and championing fundamental change. Great Yarmouth constituents, seize this opportunity to demand change. Rupert Lowe urges you to join him in reshaping the future of our nation. Lend your vote to Reform UK, and together, we can build a stronger, safer, and more prosperous Britain. Rupert Lowe, a prominent businessman and former Member of the European Parliament (MEP), is standing as the Reform UK candidate for the Great Yarmouth constituency in the upcoming general election. Lowe, known for his staunch support of Brexit and his advocacy for political and economic reform, brings a wealth of experience to his campaign, aiming to address the pressing concerns of voters in Great Yarmouth. His candidacy reflects Reform UK's growing presence in British politics, as the party seeks to offer voters a genuine alternative to the traditional political parties, focusing on issues such as national sovereignty, economic revitalization, and stronger border control. Rupert Lowe's political career took off when he was elected as an MEP for the Brexit Party in 2019, representing the West Midlands. During his time in the European Parliament, Lowe became a vocal advocate for the UK's complete withdrawal from the European Union, arguing that the country needed to reclaim its sovereignty and economic independence. His tenure was marked by a commitment to ensuring that Brexit was delivered in full, without compromises that would keep the UK tied to EU regulations. Before entering politics, Lowe had a successful career in business, particularly as chairman of Southampton Football Club, where he became known for his strategic leadership and financial acumen. His background in business, combined with his experience in European politics, gives him a unique perspective on the intersection of economics and governance. Since leaving the European Parliament, Lowe has continued to advocate for reform in the UK's political and economic systems, which he believes have become too centralized and unresponsive to the needs of ordinary people. Great Yarmouth, a coastal town in Norfolk, is a key battleground for Reform UK. Historically, the area has faced economic challenges, including high levels of unemployment and underinvestment in public services. Like many coastal communities, Great Yarmouth was hit hard by the decline of traditional industries such as fishing and tourism, and voters have grown increasingly frustrated with the perceived lack of attention from Westminster. These challenges were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted the town's economy. Rupert Lowe's decision to stand as the Reform UK candidate for Great Yarmouth is rooted in his belief that the town has been neglected by both Labour and Conservative governments. He aims to offer a fresh perspective and practical solutions to address the economic and social challenges facing the constituency. Lowe's campaign is built on the idea that Great Yarmouth can once again thrive through targeted economic policies, greater investment in local infrastructure, and a focus on reviving industries that have long been overlooked. Lowe's platform in Great Yarmouth focuses on several key issues that resonate with local voters. One of his top priorities is economic revitalization. He believes that Great Yarmouth, like many parts of the UK, has been left behind in the broader national economic strategy. To address this, Lowe advocates for policies that encourage local business growth, reduce taxes, and cut through unnecessary red tape. He supports the creation of free ports and special economic zones in coastal areas like Great Yarmouth, which would offer tax incentives to attract new businesses and create jobs. Immigration is another central theme of Lowe's campaign. Great Yarmouth, with its aging population and limited job market, has seen public services stretched thin in recent years. Lowe argues that tighter immigration controls are essential to reduce the strain on services such as healthcare, housing, and education. He supports a points-based immigration system, which would ensure that only individuals with skills that directly benefit the UK economy are allowed to settle in the country. Lowe is also a proponent of significant political reform. Like many in Reform UK, he believes that the current political system is broken and overly focused on the needs of London and the southeast, to the detriment of regions like Norfolk. He advocates for greater accountability in government and supports measures such as proportional representation to ensure that all voices are heard in Parliament, not just those of the largest political parties. Rupert Lowe's candidacy for Great Yarmouth under the Reform UK banner offers voters a new vision for the future of their constituency. With a platform focused on economic growth, tighter immigration controls, and political reform, Lowe aims to address the frustrations of voters who feel that both Labour and Conservative parties have failed to deliver meaningful change. As the general election approaches, his campaign will undoubtedly draw attention from those seeking a fresh approach to politics and a renewed commitment to local communities like Great Yarmouth. Lowe's experience in business and politics makes him a formidable candidate, capable of offering practical solutions to the issues that matter most to the people of Great Yarmouth.",

His professional journey began with a chemistry training at London University, leading him to run a small business specializing in pharmaceutical testing equipment. John's mother, an English dress designer who survived World War II while much of her family did not, worked for the renowned studio Susan Small. Her brothers, both skilled instrument makers, contributed significantly to wartime efforts, with one making artificial horizons for the RAF and the other sextants for the Royal Navy. Tragically, both perished in the Blitz. John's father, a Polish national, endured a Siberian Gulag until 1941, when he was permitted to travel to Jerusalem. Despite being underage, he joined the army and later served as a navigator in the RAF's 301 Bomber Squadron. His experience underscores the Polish airmen's view of England as the \"island of last hope.\" Many Polish airmen, including John's father, were allowed to remain in England after the war, escaping the grim fate of those returning to Soviet-occupied Poland. This experience was deeply influenced by the loss of John's great-grandfather and his brother, who were executed by Bolsheviks in the early 20th century. John's upbringing instilled in him a strong sense of duty and responsibility, values deeply rooted in his father's privileged pre-war Polish background. His commitment to these principles is evident in his involvement in local politics, including serving as Mayor of Sawbridgeworth. During his tenure, John supported the RAF ATC Squadron No. 309, a Polish wartime reconnaissance unit, and admired its inspirational leadership and youth training programs. John has been actively involved in local charitable work, previously serving as a trustee for a local Day Centre. His efforts focused on raising funds and securing sponsorships to support elderly citizens who relied on the center for social interaction and essential services. Recently, John was honored with an invitation to join a Guild in the City of London. This role allows him to contribute to preserving heritage, managing a poverty fund, and supporting skill development for young people. His involvement also includes aiding soup kitchens and providing sustenance to those in need. John and his wife actively support the Battle of Britain Memorial Fund in Capel-le-Ferne, making annual contributions to honor those who sacrificed their lives for freedom.

During his tenure, the hospital saw a 25% increase in Completed Patient Episodes with only a 5% rise in real income, becoming the top-performing hospital in the region.

His stance has been validated by subsequent developments, demonstrating his practical understanding of NHS issues beyond mere theoretical discussion. Charles also held the position of Chairman of the Board of Governors for Regent's College and the European Business School.

Born in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, in June 1955, Antony Love's early years were shaped by his father's 17-year career in the Royal Navy. The family moved frequently along the south coast, and Antony spent a brief period living above a chip shop near the Harwich lighthouse.

In 1987, Antony opened his first Licensed Betting Office in Haslemere, Surrey. For the next 30 years, he operated as an independent bookmaker. However, increasing regulatory costs and internet competition led to the closure of his last shop in Liphook, Hampshire, in August 2018.

Like many, Pamela became disillusioned with the Conservative Party due to its inconsistency in delivering on promises. This frustration led her to join Reform UK, a party she believes will provide the consistency and reliability she has long sought in politics. Pamela is thrilled to have been selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for the Maldon constituency. Reform UK, according to Pamela, has given her hope that Britain can once again be a country where everyone can feel proud and safe, regardless of their background. Pamela is committed to representing the constituents of Maldon, promising to be accessible and attentive to their concerns. She is passionate about speaking up for truth and justice and vows to fight for the issues that matter most to the people of the region. From tighter immigration control to addressing the strain on the NHS caused by unchecked mass immigration, Pamela stands with Reform UK's policies aimed at restoring order and security in Britain. Pamela's compassion extends to vulnerable adults and children, particularly those who suffer from mental or physical abuse due to family breakdowns or external threats. She also holds a deep respect for the men and women in the armed forces, recognizing the sacrifices they make to protect the United Kingdom. For Pamela, ensuring that these groups are adequately supported is a core part of her mission. Pamela believes that only Reform UK has the vision and determination to heal Britain's fractured society. By supporting Reform UK and electing Pamela Walford as PPC for Maldon, constituents can trust in her commitment to bring about real and meaningful change. Pamela's goal is to restore greatness to Britain, a place where safety, pride, and justice prevail.",

    "biography": "Dave Holland was born in Ampthill, located in the heart of the Mid Bedfordshire Constituency. After residing in Flitwick and Haynes West End, he now lives in Shillington with his wife, Mandy, and their dogs. Professionally an IT consultant, Dave's journey into politics began with campaigning for the Brexit Party. He later joined Reform UK, actively participating in both local and Parliamentary politics. Notably, he stood in the 2023 Mid Bedfordshire by-election, securing the highest number of votes ever achieved by a Reform UK candidate up to that point. Dave's dedication to campaigning is evident. Since his appointment to Mid Bedfordshire in early 2022, he has proactively introduced himself to residents by delivering 60,000 leaflets and engaging in numerous conversations. During the Mid Bedfordshire by-election campaign, which lasted 132 consecutive days, Dave, alongside a committed team, knocked on 40,000 doors and organized local events featuring prominent Reform UK speakers. He is deeply committed to promoting the Party's policies throughout the Mid Bedfordshire constituency, which will see a reduced electorate of 71,748 in the 2024 general election due to newly defined boundaries. Dave has actively participated in several local campaigns, including opposing the development of Greenwoods New Town between Barton-le-Clay and Silsoe and supporting the establishment of a GP surgery in Wixams. Mid Bedfordshire has experienced the third-largest growth in new homes in the country without corresponding improvements in local services. The lack of new GP surgeries, dental services, school places, and infrastructure spending has led to a declining standard of living, with residents facing long wait times for appointments and difficulty accessing essential services. Moreover, the area lacks any bank branches, forcing residents to travel to Bedford, Luton, or Hitchin for banking needs. The new banking hub in Ampthill, while a positive step, does not offer essential services like cash handling for local businesses. Dave is standing for Reform UK because he is dissatisfied with the lackluster representation over recent decades that has led to the current state of affairs. He believes residents deserve better value for their taxes and that many local issues stem from national policies, including mass immigration and costly net zero agendas.",

He believes Britain is on the edge of multiple crises, including a looming debt crisis, an escalating energy crisis, and increasing health challenges, all compounded by the risk of global conflict. Kher highlights the detrimental impact of Britain's reliance on foreign energy sources, which has entangled the nation in conflicts in the Middle East. He points out that high energy costs have led to the decline of domestic manufacturing and have forced countless families to choose between heating their homes and affording basic necessities. Despite unprecedented levels of funding, NHS waiting lists have surged to record highs. Kher attributes this troubling trend to poor service management and ineffective policies, underscoring the urgent need for reform. Kher warns of the dangers associated with Britain's unprecedented dependency on foreign imports, which leaves the country vulnerable to potential global conflicts. He advocates for policies that will enhance national self-sufficiency and reduce this reliance. In Mid-Norfolk, Kher observes neglect and mismanagement of infrastructure, leading to problems such as flooding, traffic congestion, and extended waiting lists. He emphasizes the need for strategic investment and better management to address these issues. Kher stresses the severity of the current debt levels, which are comparable to wartime figures despite peacetime conditions. He warns that without significant changes, the situation will only deteriorate further. Kabeer Kher believes that turning things around is still possible with the right policies. Reform UK offers a vision for transforming the UK's political landscape, including a new electoral system where every vote matters, a British constitution that safeguards individual rights like free speech, and a revised chamber of accountability free from party donor influence.",

Voters face a clear choice: either support the failing status quo or embrace genuine political reform. The major political parties in the UK have become synonymous with stagnation. Both are led by out-of-touch career politicians who advocate for high taxes, expansive government, increasing debt, and excessive regulation.

Sue believes that politics affects every aspect of our lives, with every decision made by central and local government having a direct impact on the community. Sue is running for election because she is deeply concerned about the erosion of democratic representation.

As a staunch advocate for equality of opportunity, James recognizes the importance of making difficult decisions and speaking out for what's right. He is driven by the principle that government resources are ultimately taxpayer money and that no politician can manage your resources better than you can. This conviction fuels his commitment to tax cuts and investing in essential sectors like the NHS, education, and sustainability. With a robust background in finance and economics, James is well-equipped to navigate complex financial issues and advocate for policies that benefit both community and country. James McMurdock is committed to steering our nation towards a brighter future. His approach is transparent and results-driven. He invites you to support him and vote on July 4th to elect him as your Member of Parliament. James's goal is to leverage his experience and dedication to deliver tangible results for South Basildon and East Thurrock. James McMurdock is far from a career politician; his experience is rooted in action and results. Growing up in Basildon, he worked diligently to earn a place at university, where he studied economics. His career began with top-tier banks, where he facilitated billions of dollars in business deals across various sectors including energy, infrastructure, and manufacturing. His professional journey includes significant roles at Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs, and Lehman Brothers, demonstrating his ability to build relationships, manage complex documentation, and achieve precision in financial dealings. James graduated from the University of Sussex with a BA in Economics, where he was elected Treasurer of the varsity Rugby Club and co-founded the Finance Society. His career and educational background highlight his commitment to excellence and his readiness to bring real, measurable change to our communities. James McMurdock, standing as the Reform UK candidate for the Basildon South constituency, represents the growing appetite for change in British politics. As a former Conservative MP, McMurdock's shift to Reform UK signals his frustration with the current political establishment and his commitment to pursuing policies that prioritize the interests of everyday Britons. His candidacy for Basildon South is built on key pillars of Reform UK's platform: stricter immigration control, economic reform, and a commitment to political accountability. McMurdock's personal political journey, combined with the historical and political context of Basildon South, sets the stage for a dynamic campaign in the upcoming general election. James McMurdock has had a long and varied career in politics, having first been elected as a Conservative MP for Basildon South in 2019. During his tenure with the Conservative Party, McMurdock focused on issues such as local economic development, improved infrastructure, and law and order. However, like many within his party, McMurdock grew disillusioned with the government's handling of key national issues, particularly Brexit and immigration. McMurdock's decision to join Reform UK reflects a broader discontent with the political status quo. He believes that the Conservative Party has failed to deliver on the promises of Brexit, particularly when it comes to reclaiming control of the nation's borders and empowering local communities. His departure from the Conservatives mirrors a wider trend of MPs and voters who feel that the party has lost its way, particularly when it comes to representing the interests of working-class voters. Reform UK, originally founded as the Brexit Party, is focused on delivering meaningful change in the UK's political and economic systems. The party advocates for a clean break from the European Union, stronger control over immigration, and significant reforms to the way the country is governed. In Basildon South, where many voters have felt left behind by the political establishment, McMurdock's campaign resonates with those who feel that the current government has failed to address their concerns. One of McMurdock's key priorities is tackling immigration. He argues that the current system is not only unsustainable but also places undue pressure on public services such as healthcare, education, and housing. McMurdock supports a points-based immigration system, which would allow the UK to admit only those individuals with skills that are essential for the country's economic growth. In Basildon South, where concerns about job security and housing availability are pressing, McMurdock's message of tighter immigration control is likely to find significant support. Economic reform is another cornerstone of McMurdock's platform. Basildon South, like many working-class constituencies, has experienced economic challenges, including rising living costs and stagnant wages. McMurdock is advocating for policies that will boost local businesses, lower taxes, and reduce unnecessary regulation. His vision is one where economic growth is driven from the ground up, with local entrepreneurs and small businesses at the forefront of recovery. He also supports initiatives such as free ports and business-friendly policies that could help stimulate economic activity in the region. McMurdock is also a strong proponent of governmental reform. Like Reform UK's leadership, he believes that the current political system is broken, with career politicians and civil servants more focused on maintaining power than addressing the concerns of ordinary citizens. McMurdock advocates for greater accountability and transparency in government, calling for reforms such as proportional representation to ensure that Parliament more accurately reflects the will of the people. The Basildon South constituency is emblematic of the broader political shifts occurring in the UK. Traditionally a Labour stronghold, the constituency swung to the Conservatives in recent elections, driven by frustration with Labour's position on Brexit and other national issues. However, with rising dissatisfaction over the Conservative government's handling of the economy and immigration, many voters in Basildon South are now looking for an alternative. McMurdock's candidacy provides that alternative, as he seeks to build on the local appetite for change that first manifested in the Brexit referendum. James McMurdock's candidacy as the Reform UK candidate for Basildon South represents a significant shift in the political landscape of the constituency. With a platform focused on immigration control, economic reform, and political accountability, McMurdock is well-positioned to tap into the frustrations of voters who feel that both the Labour and Conservative parties have failed to deliver on their promises. As the general election approaches, McMurdock's message of change and reform is likely to resonate with a constituency eager for new leadership and fresh ideas. His campaign will be one to watch as Reform UK continues to challenge the established political order.",

    "biography": "Chris Harrison is honoured to be the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Reform UK in South Norfolk. With deep roots in the area, Harrison's connection to Norfolk dates back to 1992 when he moved to the region to pursue a PhD at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. His journey began as a postgraduate student in what is now the South Norfolk Constituency, eventually leading to a distinguished career in research, management, and director roles within the university sector. Since 2012, Harrison has transitioned into the private sector, focusing on start-up companies that commercialise innovative products and concepts. Recently, he served as the managing director of a plant-based food venture in Norfolk, working alongside scientists, farmers, major retailers, and catering services, including school catering. His entrepreneurial spirit is evident in his retail business, which has grown from a home office to a thriving shop on a Norfolk village high street. Married to a full-time GP, Harrison has gained significant insight into the challenges facing the NHS and healthcare sector. His household discussions frequently revolve around healthcare issues, deepening his understanding of the sector's needs. Harrison's 17-year-old daughter, studying graphic design at a Norwich college, faces the generational challenges amplified by recent global events, reflecting his awareness of the contemporary issues impacting youth. Harrison's political journey began with the Conservatives, where he served as a Broadland District Council councillor and supported the party since his student days in Leeds. However, disillusionment with the Conservative Party's leadership and internal conflicts has led him to Reform UK. He finds Reform UK's fresh approach and diverse candidate pool, with experience in small businesses and public services, a compelling alternative. Harrison values the opportunity to contribute without being part of the political elite and is committed to driving radical change. Bringing a wealth of experience from both public and private sectors, Harrison is dedicated to enhancing the rural economy of South Norfolk while capitalising on opportunities from Norwich Research Park's workforce. His goals include reducing taxation, improving public services, and eliminating waste in unaccountable bodies like the BBC and NHS management. Harrison's background in science and business has highlighted the importance of skilled migration. He acknowledges the benefits of welcoming skilled individuals to the UK but also recognises the need for controlled immigration policies to avoid the pitfalls of unchecked labour influx. He critiques past and current policies on immigration and crime, advocating for more effective solutions. Chris Harrison invites support from the community, promising to work diligently as a force for good and positive change. His commitment to South Norfolk and his vision for Reform UK represent a new direction in addressing the challenges faced by both the local and national landscape.",

Beverley is critical of the government's handling of Brexit, feeling that it was a missed opportunity and a superficial attempt to gain political favor. Throughout the Brexit debates, Beverley found Richard Tice's arguments persuasive, alongside those of Nigel Farage. She was frustrated by what she perceived as biased propaganda promoting the Remain side, believing a fairer debate could have led to more support for Leave. Beverley also expressed disappointment with the BBC's coverage, criticizing its lack of balanced representation for the Leave campaign. Beverley's decision to enter politics was influenced by the perceived mishandling of the pandemic and restrictions on free speech. She is critical of the current unelected Prime Minister, particularly regarding his support for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and his association with the World Economic Forum (WEF). Beverley views these positions and the Prime Minister's record on UK finances as indicative of broader mismanagement. Beverley believes that Reform UK stands out for its practical, common-sense policies. She opposes CBDC and the WEF and advocates for a government that prioritizes fiscal responsibility and transparency. Her aim is to foster a fairer society that truly serves the interests of its citizens.

    "biography": "When I was 10 years old, I remember having discussions about politics with my family I could see then that the Government made decisions and how it affected the people to me it seemed they had so much power I go back to the days of Harold Wilson. The working class were Labour voters and the well to do conservative. Growing up I always wondered why those voting wouldn't change to another party after they had been let down and how they had to struggle because of broken manifestos so I made my mind up never to be loyal to any one party and if the one in power didn't deliver on their promises I wouldn't vote for them, my own family have to vote but choose who they feel is right for them \"it's their choice\" and we all have to live with the consequence's. I was a UKIP member then Brexit now Reform I believe this country can be successful again manufacturing, creating, repairing the infrastructure improve our Farms to grow food NOT Solar Panels or housing which should be on Brown field land. Personally, I'd say if you have the right property to have Solar you get it for free and use what you need, the feed in goes back to the grid I believe in Nationalising Utility companies Thames water is a fine example \u00a318 BILLION in an illegal debt because they can only borrow 60% of their assets, they've reached 80%. Now they want a 40% INCREASE IN YOUR WATER RATES\u2026 \"YOUR\". With new technology Tulip turbines are a great way of producing energy and in the right place in your garden could run all day. We need to deal with the FLOURIDE in water (POISON English Dictionary) and get it stopped we have so many people getting cancer these days and it's no wonder having chemicals in everything we buy or consume. Let's get back to today's problems Reform UK Party is the only party that is prepared to deal with the issues that's why I'm standing the Conservatives have BANKRUPTED this country they just don't care they say they do but let's look at all the Lobbying for PPE/PPI Contracts how much was actually \"FIT FOR PURPOSE AND SAFE\" we've heard NHS staff say they were useless, scientists said they didn't work but this Government still paid for them and paid to burn millions of them. Why didn't we get our money back? These people have become very wealthy because of these USELESS PRODUCTS our Tax payer's money\u2026.and they Johnson, Truss, Sunak haven't chased the payback it's been written off because they were donors. This money should be used for the NHS, Schools, training apprenticeships, repairing potholes. If you vote Labour, you get Blair, Starmer's mentor and advisor they believe in the W.H.O control and W.E.F bearing in mind they were in Davos together with Von Der Leyen, Starmer said he wants closer ties with the EU so that will mean re-joining and losing control of our country. Andrew Neil show when Starmer denied re-joining the EU and Neil showed him a video showing the opposite (FLIP FLOP). This country is a BUSINESS and if you have BAD MANAGEMENT the company struggles or goes bust so we need to change the BOARD and bring in NEW people with business experience to sort the problems out revive the company and prosper. So, this isn't about one person standing as a PPC this is about changing the management at the top the more REFORM Candidates get elected the chance of this country surviving and being able to deal with the issues.",

    "biography": "Anthony New, a recently retired Electrical Engineer, brings extensive experience from a distinguished career with British industrial companies across Bristol and the UK. Born and raised in North-East Bristol, Anthony has lived in Easton, Eastville, and Fishponds, where he currently resides. He is a family man, married with one daughter, and has a variety of interests, including singing, cycling, motorbikes, and classic British cars. Anthony New is running for parliament driven by his frustration with the mismanagement of Broken Britain. He is determined to see a comprehensive reform of the government, which he believes is currently ineffective and detached from the needs of ordinary citizens. He criticizes the political system for being controlled by an elite managerial class that disregards the real concerns of the public. Anthony believes that only a political revolution, led by Reform UK, can address these issues effectively. Britain has a proud history of welcoming people from diverse backgrounds, enriching the nation culturally and economically. However, recent years have seen an unprecedented surge in immigration, with over one million new arrivals last year alone and more expected this year. This rapid increase has outpaced the country's ability to provide adequate housing and healthcare services. The current system is overwhelmed, and the government has not kept up with the demand for new homes or healthcare professionals. Anthony New advocates for reducing annual immigration from one million to a few thousand, a policy only supported by Reform UK, as other parties are content with the status quo. Under both the Tory and Labour governments, taxation has reached historic levels, affecting everyone from adults paying for energy to children facing VAT on sweets, retirees dealing with taxes on pensions, and estates burdened by inheritance tax. Anthony New argues that high taxation is a consequence of excessive government intervention and inefficiency. He believes that to reduce taxes, the government must cut its size and spending by reducing the number of civil servants, departments, and quangos. Reform UK is the only party committed to this reduction, whereas others continue to support a bloated state. Anthony New recognizes the many issues plaguing Broken Britain and emphasizes that true reform is needed to address these problems. He argues that other parties are content with superficial changes and lack the will to implement meaningful reform. Anthony urges voters to move beyond traditional party loyalties and choose a party that genuinely seeks transformative change. He believes that Reform UK is the only party capable of delivering the necessary reforms, and he encourages voters to support them for real, substantive change.",

Having moved to the county two years ago, he is now a father of two daughters, with his youngest born during his campaign. His motivation to run for office stems from his desire to secure a brighter future for his children and their generation. Stephen Talbot brings extensive experience from both the public and private sectors. He has served as a Royal Navy officer and has worked across technology, defense, financial, and maritime markets as both an employee and entrepreneur. Over the past two decades, he has observed with concern how successive governments have overseen economic stagnation and a decline in living standards. Talbot believes that the current system has failed the people. Successive governments have outsourced decision-making to unelected and unaccountable \"experts\" within executive agencies, quangos, and international bodies. This has resulted in policies that prioritize coercion over freedom, corporatism over competition, and division over unity. He argues that voters are consistently given policies they rejected, leading to increased costs for producers and, ultimately, consumers-creating a cycle of decline. Stephen Talbot firmly believes that governing means making choices. He recalls the 2016 EU Referendum, during which he led Business for Britain under Vote Leave, as a pivotal moment when the British public voted to restore sovereignty to the UK Parliament. However, he feels the current political class has proven incapable of making and upholding these necessary choices. According to Talbot, Reform UK is committed to true leadership, understanding that the government must make bold choices to lead the nation. He asserts that only with comprehensive reform of Britain's state institutions can the country return to prosperity and ensure a brighter future for all. Stephen Talbot urges voters in East Wiltshire to support Reform UK in the upcoming election on 4th July, emphasizing that a vote for Reform UK is a vote for real change and a better future for the next generation.",

His decision to engage in politics stems from a deep-seated concern for the future of his beloved country and the well-being of its people. In 2023, the United Kingdom faces a series of unprecedented challenges. Uncontrolled illegal immigration continues unabated, with tens of thousands crossing the borders each year. Despite the staggering financial burden on taxpayers, the government seems either unable or unwilling to address the issue effectively. Meanwhile, the National Health Service struggles under the weight of a patient backlog exceeding 7.4 million, and public sector strikes are reminiscent of the tumultuous 1970s. The country is also grappling with soaring inflation, with no clear strategy from the Bank of England. Many citizens are finding it increasingly difficult to afford basic necessities such as housing, food, and energy. This economic instability is further exacerbated by net-zero policies being imposed without public consent. These policies, dictated by global entities like the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, are contributing to higher costs of living through taxes and utility bill levies, leaving many to question their true benefit. The tax burden is at its highest in 70 years, while the quality and availability of public services continue to decline. The erosion of public trust in the political system is evident, following a series of scandals involving misuse of expenses, \"partygate,\" and other unethical behaviors.

It's an opportunity to reject the status quo and hold accountable the parties that have failed the nation. The Conservative Party has, over the past 14 years, introduced high taxes, Net Zero policies, increased cost of living, rampant crime, and mismanagement of the NHS. The Labour Party, meanwhile, supports similar problematic policies and has shown a preference for closer ties with Brussels, undermining the democratic will of the people.

He pursued higher education at Reading and Keele Universities, and subsequently embarked on a diverse career across the UK and Georgia, USA. Bagley taught Politics, English, and Mathematics and was involved in the development of educational software through two businesses he founded. In addition to his entrepreneurial ventures, he authored and published political thrillers including Michael Bagley's political journey reflects a transition from the disintegrating Labour movement of his youth to the more visionary platforms of UKIP and Reform UK. His political stance emphasizes the importance of the nation-state in contrast to the globalist agendas of the EU, WEF, and Davos. Bagley argues that the full potential of Brexit remains unrealized under the current Tory Government, which has failed to sever ties with globalist food and energy markets. He highlights the need for energy independence as a critical step to mitigate the impact of global conflicts, such as the Russian invasion, which has led to soaring gas prices and a cost-of-living crisis in the UK. While Michael Bagley has maintained a low profile in political activism outside his early engagement in the Brexit referendum, he is now motivated by a sense of urgency to address the current state of the UK. He believes that Reform UK offers practical solutions to restore the nation's strength, including in immigration policy. The 2016 Brexit vote signaled a desire for both economic and border control. However, the Conservative government has deviated from this commitment. Instead of adhering to promises of limiting immigration, over 2 million people legally entered the UK in 2021 and 2022, with projections for 2023 reaching 1.2 million. Illegal migration has resulted in significant financial burdens on taxpayers, with daily costs amounting to \u00a38 million for legal fees, allowances, and accommodation. Since 2010, net migration has added the equivalent of three cities the size of Birmingham to the population. Contrary to the perception that mass immigration benefits the economy, Bagley argues that it undermines it by introducing a surplus of cheap labor that depresses wages for the native population. Additionally, many dependents of migrants are non-working and reliant on state support. The strain on essential infrastructure-such as housing, schools, and healthcare-further exacerbates the situation. Reform UK's policies aim to curb illegal migration and support genuine refugees, addressing these critical issues effectively.",

Since 1997, Giane has observed the gradual erosion of national identity under successive Labour and Conservative governments. Concerned about the impact this erosion will have on future generations, Giane has decided to run for Parliament to effect positive change for Cornwall. One major concern is the loss of control over immigration, both legal and illegal, which has occurred under previous Labour, Conservative/Liberal Coalition, and recent Conservative governments. This lack of control is costing the nation billions annually and imposing additional financial burdens on local councils and government departments. The backlog of over 7.4 million patients and the strain on hospitals due to insufficient investment and poor planning are critical issues. Additionally, the surge in house building and immigration has exacerbated these problems, revealing the inadequacies in our healthcare and housing systems. The country has suffered from strikes that have diminished productivity and an ineffective Bank of England that has failed to control inflation, leading to increased costs of mortgages, energy, food, and rent. The adoption of Net Zero policies without fully assessing their impact, combined with local councils declaring Climate Emergencies without considering community effects, adds to the list of challenges. The highest tax rates since the 1950s, exacerbated by frozen allowances, continue to rise annually under both Conservative and Labour governments. The expenses scandal and lack of transparency have fostered distrust in politicians, further undermining public confidence. Born and raised in Carbis Bay, and with a local education, Giane Mortimer is deeply committed to the community. He feels a strong obligation to give back to Cornwall, particularly the St Ives and Scilly Isles Constituency, including Penzance.

Having done so, when the results were announced, I was happy that the UK had signalled its intention to leave the European Union. I then watched 3 years of lies and deception as politicians and civil servants went out of their way to stall the process. I could see what was happening and felt powerless and increasingly annoyed. Then came Boris with his oven ready Brexit deal which again was a farce but got him into power. Again, I thought, well that's the best we are going to get. Then came Covid. As a plumber, I worked all the way through and took only the first tranche of the relief payments. The government asked whether my business had been adversely affected; as it was not, I pursued no further payments. I then watched the government give millions away to con men and Conservative Party members and then make up lies to keep us controlled. All this time I WAS getting increasingly frustrated with the self-serving political class. Meanwhile general elections came and went, local elections came and went. There was never an option to vote for Reform UK. I thought, that if I didn't feel I could ever vote Conservative or Labour and there wasn't a candidate for Reform UK there must many more people that felt the same as me. I therefore put myself forward as a Reform Party candidate, not for myself but to give all those unhappy with the two major parties someone, and indeed something, to vote for. I have never done anything like this before. I am looking for people who can help me in every way from advice to helping with leaflet drops and walkabouts. I believe if we can get the word out, send a message to the people, we stand a good chance of getting a result. I find from talking to people that some don't even know about Reform UK, so leaflets and walkabouts initially will be most successful.

However, as the coal industry declined by the time he left school, the local area suffered severe economic and social impacts. Mark began his career in a local engineering factory in Bridgend, where he worked for over twenty years.

As a proud UK citizen raising his family in Wales, he holds a deep appreciation for the country, believing it to be one of the best places in the world to live and work. His commitment to the community and its future is unwavering, driven by a desire to protect the values and opportunities that make Wales so special. While Joshua Kim values a quiet life, the alarming increase of approximately 700,000 net migrants to the UK for the second consecutive year has moved him to act. He recognizes the significant challenges this influx poses for working-class families, who face rising competition for low-skilled jobs, and for young people, who struggle to find affordable housing. Meanwhile, big businesses profit from a surplus of cheap labour, widening inequality. Joshua Kim firmly believes that Reform is the only party addressing these pressing issues. For him, advocating for tighter immigration controls is about practicality, not prejudice. He highlights that every immigrant, regardless of background, requires housing, healthcare, and public services-resources that are currently overstretched. This is a particularly local issue for Caerphilly, where he sees national spending on mass immigration reducing funding for Wales and his community. Joshua Kim is a reserved and polite Briton, but he believes the time has come to stand up for his family and country. Having experienced different cultures, he feels strongly that British culture-with its democratic values, equal rights for women, and freedoms of speech and religion-must be protected. He sees these values as worth fighting for, especially in the face of societal changes. Joshua Kim is also deeply concerned about the decline in children's mental health and attention spans, which sociologists link to the rise in social media use. He supports Reform's push for app-restricted smartphones to safeguard children's wellbeing. On energy policy, Joshua Kim is skeptical of the reliability of renewable energy sources, noting that \"the wind doesn't always blow.\" He advocates for nuclear energy as a safe, reliable solution, pointing to France's successful use of nuclear reactors without fatalities. He supports Reform's call for UK-made Small Modular Reactors to secure the country's energy future. After 25 years of Labour rule in Wales, Joshua Kim believes they have failed the people of Caerphilly. He feels they've taken voters for granted, offering contempt rather than solutions. His frustrations include Welsh Labour imposing a candidate on Caerphilly without local consultation, Vaughan Gething clinging to power despite losing a vote of confidence, and the costly, unpopular 20mph speed limit policy. Joshua Kim believes it's time for a political earthquake, and every vote matters. By voting for him and Reform on July 4th, the people of Caerphilly can send a powerful message to Westminster: the demand for significant cuts to mass immigration and real change is loud and clear.",

    "biography": "Carolyn Grant emphasizes that current Net Zero policies and excessive regulations have negatively impacted the farming industry. Reform UK advocates for allowing farmers with land under 500 hectares to manage their properties according to their expertise and knowledge. Additionally, the organization seeks to inspire more young individuals to pursue careers in farming, ensuring a vibrant future for the agricultural sector. The Borders are facing a critical shortage of affordable housing, putting local housing associations under significant pressure as they strive to meet the needs of those seeking homes. Carolyn Grant aims to assist young people in staying within the rural communities they grew up in by promoting vocational training in trades that support the construction and restoration of homes. This initiative is designed to empower the youth to build their futures while contributing to the revitalization of the Borders' housing landscape. The NHS stands as the largest employer in the Borders; however, a significant shortage of medical personnel persists. Carolyn Grant proposes that Reform UK will address this issue by incentivizing healthcare professionals to return to frontline NHS roles. This plan includes offering a zero basic rate tax for three years and forgiving student loans after a decade of service, or on a pro-rata basis depending on the length of their service. This initiative aims to enhance the NHS's capacity to serve the community effectively.",

    "biography": "David Kirkwood is an experienced engineer with deep roots in Lanarkshire and Dumfriesshire. Born in Baillieston, within the sound of lions roaring, he has always called Scotland home, despite having lived in various parts of England, Wales, Luxembourg, and Sweden. David's professional journey began at the young age of nine as a lathe operator in his family's machine shop, a foundation that has shaped his career in small business and consultancy. For over 30 years, David has worked as a freelance IT consultant, providing invaluable support to more than 40 companies across diverse sectors, including the Civil Service, NHS, banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. His vast experience and problem-solving skills have made him a trusted figure in helping businesses navigate complex challenges. David's first formal political involvement came as the successful election agent for an independent council candidate in South Lanarkshire. However, it was his growing concern for the future of his country that motivated him to step forward as the Reform UK Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale, and Tweeddale. His decision was driven by fear, fury, and frustration: fear of the direction Scotland was heading, fury at the ongoing issues, and frustration that no meaningful action was being taken. Now, David is committed to being part of the solution, working tirelessly to bring about positive change for his community. David currently resides in Moffat, located at the heart of his constituency. Having spent most of his life in rural areas, he understands the unique challenges faced by these communities. The loss of essential services, such as police stations, and the reduction in public transport have been detrimental to rural life. Additionally, rising energy costs due to Net Zero policies have severely impacted the farming industry. David believes that addressing the need for affordable housing and creating local job opportunities is crucial for helping young people remain in the communities they love. He supports Reform UK Scotland's policies that encourage small businesses and entrepreneurship, aiming to regenerate the local economy and build a brighter future for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale, and Tweeddale.",

Born in Dundee, Scotland, Derek was raised by a nurse and an RAF aircraft technician. He moved to Edinburgh in 1996 to attend the University of Edinburgh, and with a few brief exceptions, he has made the city his home ever since. Now residing in Musselburgh with his wife and dog, Derek works as a management consultant, bringing his expertise to both his professional and political life. Derek's political journey began in 2021, driven by his dissatisfaction with how both the UK and Scottish governments handled the COVID-19 pandemic. During this challenging time, Reform UK stood out as the only party addressing the harmful impact of lockdowns, which were based on questionable science and unreliable computer models. Derek saw the need for a party that was willing to stand up for the people and challenge government decisions that threatened livelihoods and freedoms. In Derek's view, the Conservative party in Westminster has lost sight of its core values and responsibilities, while the SNP in Holyrood continues to stumble from scandal to scandal. Derek believes that both parties need a reminder of their duty to serve the people who elected them. As a Reform UK candidate, he is committed to championing the voices of his constituents and advocating for real change in government, focused on accountability, transparency, and better governance for all.",

He has a passion for golf, enjoying the challenge of the renowned links courses along the Ayrshire and Lothian/Fife coastline. While he no longer plays football, Simon remains a dedicated fan and sees himself as an everyday man who is disillusioned with the repeated failures and empty promises of the major political parties. He is determined to bring about real change and believes Reform UK is the party that can make it happen. Simon stands with Reform UK because it is the only political party committed to scrapping Net Zero. He believes that the current policies unfairly burden ordinary citizens with inflated fuel prices while countries like China continue to increase their emissions. Rather than addressing the issue, the UK offshores its environmental challenges. By ending Net Zero, Simon believes the UK can achieve Energy and Food Independence, empowering farmers to produce more food domestically and reducing reliance on imports. Simon is also vocal about the growing \"war on the motorist.\" He criticizes policies like low traffic neighborhoods (LTNs), low emission zones, and excessive speed cameras, which he believes are designed to squeeze more money from everyday drivers. He argues that these measures, along with inflated parking charges, are unfair, especially in rural areas where public transport is not a viable alternative. Simon is also concerned about the worsening state of UK roads, filled with potholes, while more charges loom with road pricing schemes. Simon is deeply troubled by the erosion of free speech, especially under the influence of the SNP and Labour. He points to how universities, schools, the media, and major corporations have been dominated by what he describes as \"woke bigots,\" who dictate what can be said in public discourse. He highlights the implementation of the Hate Crime Bill in Scotland and the earlier Named Person Scheme as examples of the state infringing on personal freedoms, even in private settings. Simon and Reform UK stand firmly against identity politics, advocating for a society based on equality of opportunity, where people are free to express their views without fear of censorship. Simon Moorehead invites voters to join him in supporting Reform UK to make Great Britain a place where everyone can take pride. He is committed to protecting personal freedoms, ending punitive policies that target ordinary citizens, and creating a fairer future for all.",

Initially practicing as a veterinary surgeon, Helen later shifted her focus to public affairs and media roles within environmental charities. Her diverse professional background has equipped her with a wide-ranging understanding of the needs of Scottish communities. This breadth of experience drives her dedication to enhancing the quality of life for local residents and fostering stronger, more vibrant communities. Having called rural Perthshire home for over 20 years, Helen McDade is acutely aware of the challenges facing the area. Issues like the closure of post offices and police stations, inadequate public transport, and the pressing need for affordable housing and job opportunities to retain young people have become urgent concerns. She recognizes the importance of revitalizing Perth city centre and believes that Reform's pro-small business policies will stimulate entrepreneurship and economic growth in the region. Helen has a proven track record as a passionate and effective campaigner. She has led efforts to protect Scotland's wild peatlands, particularly against industrial energy projects such as the proposed 200m turbines in Kinross-shire. Additionally, she has successfully brought critical health issues to the attention of political leaders, showcasing her deep understanding of parliamentary processes and her ability to influence decision-making. Brexit offered a historic opportunity for the UK to regain control of its decision-making, but Helen believes this promise remains unfulfilled. The Conservative government, despite its \"Get Brexit Done\" mandate, has failed to break free from the EU's regulatory grip, as evidenced by the retention of thousands of unnecessary EU laws. Helen is determined to ensure Brexit's full potential is realized. Helen advocates for abolishing the restrictive Net Zero targets, which she sees as a significant burden on the UK economy. She believes in a balanced approach to environmental policies that prioritize economic vitality alongside sustainability. Helen is critical of the UK's bloated tax code, which now exceeds 20,000 pages-the longest in the world and more than three times the size it was in 1997. She supports comprehensive tax reform to simplify the system, making it fairer and more transparent for all.",
